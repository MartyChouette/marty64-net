## The VG101 Framework

VG101 teaches videogames as their own medium, not through borrowed frameworks from film, literature, or game theory. The core innovation is the **Gesture + Aesthetic Heritage** framework.

### Core Concepts (in order of importance)

#### 1. Gesture

**Definition:** The surface area of contact between player and videogame.

**Critical nuances:**
- Gesture is NOT a single action or button press
- Gesture is NOT a fixed size or length
- Gesture is the SUM of everything happening when a videogame is being played
- A Gesture can be a micro-moment (0.2 seconds of a jump apex) OR an entire 40-hour videogame
- Do NOT conflate Gesture with "action" or "mechanic" - Gesture contains actions but is not reducible to them
- The term comes from multiple traditions: film theory (mise-en-scene), dance, painting, music, rhetoric

A Gesture is composed of the 4 A's, experienced as one inseparable thing when playing, but separable when analyzing.

#### 2. The 4 A's

**Action, Art, Arc, Atmosphere** - the four components of a Gesture.

| A | Definition |
|---|------------|
| **Action** | What the videogame has the player do, INCLUDING absence of direct or immediate interaction. A cutscene is an Action (watching). A pause is an Action (not acting). |
| **Art** | Art direction, lighting, staging, camera grammar, composition, sound design, and the heritage of these choices. NOT just "graphics quality" - a pixel art videogame has Art choices just as much as AAA. |
| **Arc** | The amount of time. Could be a micro-moment, a long moment, or an entire videogame. Not the same as "pacing" though pacing is part of it. Answers: how long does this last, and what shape does it take? |
| **Atmosphere** | The feeling and vibe experienced from the videogame. What EMERGES when Action, Art, and Arc combine. Not something added on top - it's what players feel as a result of everything else. |

**Important:** When playing, the 4 A's are inseparable - you experience them as one thing. When analyzing, you pull them apart to understand how each contributes.

**Why "Art" not "Aesthetic":** We use "Art" for the visual/audio component and reserve "Aesthetic" for Aesthetic Heritage (below). This avoids confusion.

#### 3. Aesthetic Heritage

**Definition:** Where the choices in EACH of the 4 A's come from. The lineage.

**Critical nuances:**
- Aesthetic Heritage covers ALL 4 A's, not just visuals
- A jump mechanic has an aesthetic heritage
- A difficulty curve has an aesthetic heritage
- A control scheme has an aesthetic heritage
- "Aesthetic" here means videogames are an aesthetic medium and all 4 A's are aesthetic choices with lineages

**Three ways videogames relate to heritage:**
1. **Inheritance** - Using a solution because it works (double-jump exists because it's proven useful)
2. **Quotation** - Deliberately referencing a source (camera work quoting a specific film)
3. **Transformation** - Taking something and making it new (Dark Souls bonfire transforms the checkpoint)

Heritage comes from: other videogames, cinema, music, visual art, theatre, dance, literature, architecture, any medium or tradition.

#### 4. Permissions

**Definition:** The boundaries of interface, contact, system, and mechanic. What the videogame allows, requires, and forbids.

**Three types:**
- **Allowed** - What the videogame lets you do (possibility space)
- **Required** - What the videogame makes you do (demands of progression)
- **Forbidden** - What the videogame prevents you from doing (boundaries)

**Critical nuances:**
- Permissions are NOT a "container" separate from Gesture
- Permissions are DISCOVERED through the 4 A's as we play (like feeling in the dark)
- We often don't know Permissions preemptively - we feel them out through the Gesture
- If we know Permissions beforehand, it's from genre conventions, marketing, other players, or prior exposure to the videogame
- Some Permissions are designed intentionally, some are accidental - both shape experience
- Permissions carry meaning: what a videogame allows/requires/forbids communicates values

## What Is NOT Part of the Core Framework

The following were considered but removed. They are now **glossary terms only**:

- Action Grammar
- Feedback & Readability  
- Meaning from Dynamics
- The Three Layers

These terms are vocabulary students learn, but not core framework concepts. Feedback, readability, and dynamics are useful terms, but they don't work as framework elements without the 4 A's.

Also NOT emphasized:
- **Magic Circle** (Huizinga) - A cool theoretical device that doesn't especially matter for videogames. Don't discuss it unless asked.

## Three-Register System

Every KB page should have three collapsible sections:

| Register | Color | Default State | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Practice** | Teal (#14b8a6) | Open | What students do. Hands-on, direct. Exercises. |
| **Craft** | Blue (#3b82f6) | Collapsed | What educators understand. Teaching sequence, common misconceptions, assessment. |
| **Theory** | Purple (#a855f7) | Collapsed | Deeper grounding. References, philosophy, unresolved questions. |

This makes the KB look like "an educator's book" with professional polish and clear visual distinction between registers.

## Terminology Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Say "videogame" (one word), never "game" or "video game"
- Use standard dashes (-), never em dashes (—) or en dashes (–)
- Link key terms to glossary pages with dotted amber underline styling

**Key terms that should be glossary-linked:**
- Gesture, The 4 A's, Action, Art, Arc, Atmosphere
- Aesthetic Heritage, Permissions
- Agency, Affordance, Mechanic, Verbs, Pacing
- Flow, Feedback Loop, Procedural Rhetoric
- Checkpoint, Coyote Time, Input Buffer, Juice

---

## Philosophy

The course believes:

- **Accessibility is craft, not compliance.** Good design is accessible design. The curb cut effect applies.
- **Debugging is literacy.** Understanding why things break makes you a better designer.
- **Code is material.** Like clay or paint - it has properties, resistances, possibilities.
- **Videogames are neither just products nor just art.** They are both and neither. The best creations know this.
- **The videogames you love to play and love to make are often different things.** This is okay.

The approach respects ALL existing videogame design knowledge (academic, social, entertainment, product) while seeing videogames as they are unto themselves - not dissecting them by cherry-picking their purpose.

---

## Player Psychology Topics

Foundations section should cover:
- Flow state (Csikszentmihalyi)
- Motivation (intrinsic vs extrinsic)
- Tetris effect
- Negative and positive feedback loops
- Human random vs computer random
- Player fair vs computer fair (coyote time, input buffering)

Feedback loops are part of player psychology, not a separate page.

---

## Weekly Rhythm

The course follows: **Play → Name → Make → Reflect**

- **Play** - Experience videogames with intention
- **Name** - Develop vocabulary for what you felt
- **Make** - Create something that embodies the concept
- **Reflect** - Articulate what you learned

## Current State / TODO

**Done:**
- Core Framework pages with three-register system
- Foundations pages (What Makes a Videogame, Player Psychology, The Design Lens)
- Glossary updated
- Portfolio with 5 videogames (Iris, RhodesTrip, Blackout, Solus, Cold Flame)
- Writings section (Blackout whitepaper linked)
- VG101 Home link added to all page sidebars
- Expanded sidebar nav (Narrative, Level Design, Systems, Pedagogy sections) added to: Framework, Foundations, Code Bank index, Case Studies index, glossary.html, references.html
- Gesture page Practice section updated with improved conversational content
- Three-register format applied to Narrative, Level Design, Systems index pages

**Still needs:**
- Add expanded sidebar nav to 16 remaining sub-pages (case-studies/*.html except index, level-design/*.html except index, pedagogy/*.html except index, systems/*.html except index)
- Update all pages to use "Art" instead of "Aesthetic" for the A
- Add more writings (YouTube, papers)
- Create splash image from screenshots
- Possibly add Code as Material page to Pedagogy

## When In Doubt

1. Use "videogame" always
2. Start with Gesture as the entry point
3. The 4 A's are Action, Art, Arc, Atmosphere (not Aesthetic)
4. Aesthetic Heritage covers lineage of ALL 4 A's
5. Permissions are discovered through the 4 A's, not a separate container
6. Practice/Craft/Theory registers for all KB pages
7. No em dashes or en dashes
8. Respect what came before while seeing videogames as their own medium
