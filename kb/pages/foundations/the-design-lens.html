            <h3>What a Lens Does</h3>
            <p>
              A lens focuses attention. It brings some things into clarity while letting
              others blur into background.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every framework is a lens. MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) is a lens.
              Formal analysis is a lens. Player experience models are lenses.
              The <a href="../framework/the-four-as.html" class="term">4 A's</a> and <a href="../framework/gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a> are a lens.
            </p>
            <p>No lens shows everything. The question is what a particular lens helps you see.</p>

            <h3>What This Lens Helps You See</h3>
            <p>The VG101 lens focuses on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Experience over abstraction.</strong> We start with what the player feels, not with systems diagrams.</li>
              <li><strong>Heritage over invention.</strong> We trace where choices come from, not pretend they emerged from nothing.</li>
              <li><strong>Craft over theory.</strong> We develop practical vocabulary for making and analyzing, not just categorizing.</li>
              <li><strong>Wholeness over dissection.</strong> We study the Gesture as a whole before pulling it apart into components.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Using Multiple Lenses</h3>
            <p>
              You don't have to pick one lens and ignore all others. Different lenses serve
              different purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're balancing an economy, MDA might help. If you're studying player behavior,
              psychology frameworks might help. If you're analyzing narrative, literary theory might help.
            </p>
            <p>The VG101 lens is particularly useful for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyzing why a moment feels the way it does</li>
              <li>Understanding where a design choice comes from</li>
              <li>Developing vocabulary to talk about videogame craft</li>
              <li>Creating intentional experiences rather than accidental ones</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>
              The goal is not to become a theorist. The goal is to become someone who can
              play a videogame and understand why it feels the way it does. And then make
              something that feels intentional.
            </p>
            <p>Theory serves practice. Analysis serves creation. The lens is a tool, not an end.</p>

            <h3>Exercise: Lens Comparison</h3>
            <p>Take a single videogame moment (e.g., landing a jump in Celeste). Analyze it through:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>MDA:</strong> What mechanics create this dynamic? What aesthetic results?</li>
              <li><strong>VG101:</strong> What is the <a href="../framework/gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a>? What are the <a href="../framework/the-four-as.html" class="term">4 A's</a>? What <a href="../framework/aesthetic-heritage.html" class="term">heritage</a> is present?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What does each lens reveal? What does each miss?</p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Respecting What Came Before</h3>
            <p>
              This framework is not about erasing the work of other videogame designers,
              theorists, or scholars. All of that knowledge is respected and in play.
            </p>
            <p>
              Academic perspectives matter. Social perspectives matter. Entertainment perspectives matter.
              Product perspectives matter. We are not here to dismiss any of these.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are here to see videogames as they are unto themselves. To analyze them
              without cherry-picking which framing serves our argument. To take them seriously
              as a medium with its own properties, its own traditions, its own craft.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Another Framework</h3>
            <p>
              Students may ask: "Why not just use MDA?" or "Why do we need new vocabulary?"
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer: existing frameworks are valuable but often privilege certain perspectives.
              MDA privileges system thinking. Formal analysis privileges structure. Player experience
              models privilege psychology.
            </p>
            <p>
              The VG101 framework privileges the felt experience and its heritage. This is a different
              entry point, not a replacement.
            </p>

            <h3>Teaching Lens-Switching</h3>
            <p>
              Students should learn to switch between lenses fluently. An exercise:
              analyze the same videogame moment three ways (MDA, player psychology, VG101).
              What does each reveal?
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is flexibility, not orthodoxy. No single lens is "correct."
            </p>

            <h3>Common Challenges</h3>
            <p><strong>"This is too abstract":</strong></p>
            <p>
              Ground everything in specific videogame moments. Never discuss Gesture without pointing
              to a concrete Gesture. Theory without examples is empty.
            </p>
            <p><strong>"I just want to make, not analyze":</strong></p>
            <p>
              Analysis serves making. You can't intentionally create a feeling you can't name.
              The vocabulary is a tool for creation, not a replacement for it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Why "Lens"</h3>
            <p>
              The lens metaphor comes from Jesse Schell's <em>The Art of Game Design</em>,
              which presents 100+ lenses for examining videogames. Each lens asks different questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use "lens" to emphasize that frameworks are tools, not truths. You look through them;
              you don't worship them.
            </p>

            <h3>Phenomenology and Experience</h3>
            <p>
              The emphasis on felt experience connects to phenomenological traditions in philosophy -
              starting from how things appear to consciousness rather than from abstract structures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brendan Keogh's work applies this to videogames explicitly. We start with the body
              playing the videogame, not with the system that the body interacts with.
            </p>

            <h3>What I'm Taking</h3>
            <p>
              The insight that frameworks are lenses, not truths. The permission to develop vocabulary
              suited to what we're studying. The commitment to experience as the starting point.
            </p>

            <h3>What I'm Resisting</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Framework wars:</strong> "MDA is wrong, VG101 is right." No. Different lenses for different purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Theory for theory's sake:</strong> The vocabulary serves making. If it doesn't help you create,
              it's not doing its job.
            </p>

            <h3>Unresolved Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Can we ever see a videogame "as it is" or only through lenses? Is there a lens-free view?</li>
              <li>How do we know when a framework is useful vs. when it's imposing structure that isn't there?</li>
              <li>What's the relationship between analyzing videogames and making them? Do they require the same skills?</li>
            </ul>
