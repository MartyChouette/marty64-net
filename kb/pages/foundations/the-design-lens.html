        <h1>The Design Lens</h1>
        
        <p class="lead">
          A way of seeing videogames as they are, not cherry-picking their purpose.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Respecting What Came Before</h2>
        
        <p>
          This framework is not about erasing the work of other videogame designers, 
          theorists, or scholars. All of that knowledge is respected and in play.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Academic perspectives matter. Social perspectives matter. Entertainment perspectives matter. 
          Product perspectives matter. We are not here to dismiss any of these.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We are here to see videogames as they are unto themselves. To analyze them 
          without cherry-picking which framing serves our argument. To take them seriously 
          as a medium with its own properties, its own traditions, its own craft.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>What a Lens Does</h2>
        
        <p>
          A lens focuses attention. It brings some things into clarity while letting 
          others blur into background.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Every framework is a lens. MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) is a lens. 
          Formal analysis is a lens. Player experience models are lenses. 
          The 4 A's and Gesture are a lens.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          No lens shows everything. The question is what a particular lens helps you see.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>What This Lens Helps You See</h2>
        
        <p>
          The VG101 lens focuses on:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Experience over abstraction.</strong> We start with what the player feels, not with systems diagrams.</li>
          <li><strong>Heritage over invention.</strong> We trace where choices come from, not pretend they emerged from nothing.</li>
          <li><strong>Craft over theory.</strong> We develop practical vocabulary for making and analyzing, not just categorizing.</li>
          <li><strong>Wholeness over dissection.</strong> We study the Gesture as a whole before pulling it apart into components.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Using Multiple Lenses</h2>
        
        <p>
          You don't have to pick one lens and ignore all others. Different lenses serve 
          different purposes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If you're balancing an economy, MDA might help. If you're studying player behavior, 
          psychology frameworks might help. If you're analyzing narrative, literary theory might help.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The VG101 lens is particularly useful for:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Analyzing why a moment feels the way it does</li>
          <li>Understanding where a design choice comes from</li>
          <li>Developing vocabulary to talk about videogame craft</li>
          <li>Creating intentional experiences rather than accidental ones</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        
        <p>
          The goal is not to become a theorist. The goal is to become someone who can 
          play a videogame and understand why it feels the way it does. And then make 
          something that feels intentional.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Theory serves practice. Analysis serves creation. The lens is a tool, not an end.
        </p>
