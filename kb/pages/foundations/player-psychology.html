        <h1>Player Psychology</h1>
        
        <p class="lead">
          Understanding how players think, feel, and respond to videogames.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Flow State</h2>
        
        <p>
          Flow is a state of complete absorption where challenge matches skill. 
          Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi identified this state across many activities, 
          but videogames are particularly good at inducing it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When challenge exceeds skill, players feel anxiety. When skill exceeds challenge, 
          players feel boredom. Flow lives in the channel between.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Videogames can dynamically adjust difficulty, pacing, and feedback to keep 
          players in flow. This is part of why they are so engaging.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        
        <p>
          Players are motivated by different things:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong>: Playing because the activity itself is rewarding. The joy of movement, discovery, mastery.</li>
          <li><strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong>: Playing for external rewards. Achievements, unlocks, leaderboards, social recognition.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Neither is better. Most players experience both. But understanding which 
          motivations your videogame serves helps you design more intentionally.
        </p>

        <h2>The Tetris Effect</h2>
        
        <p>
          When you play a videogame intensely, it can bleed into your non-play life. 
          You see Tetris shapes when you close your eyes. You think about optimal routes 
          while walking. You dream about the videogame.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This phenomenon, named after Tetris, shows how deeply videogames can embed 
          themselves in cognition. It's a testament to how effectively videogames 
          train patterns of thought and perception.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Feedback Loops</h2>
        
        <p>
          Feedback loops occur when the output of a system becomes input to that system. 
          Videogames are full of them.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Positive Feedback Loops</h3>
        <p>
          Amplify change. The rich get richer. A player who is winning gains advantages 
          that help them win more. This creates snowballing, runaway leaders, decisive endings.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Negative Feedback Loops</h3>
        <p>
          Dampen change. Pull toward equilibrium. A player who is losing gains advantages 
          (rubber-banding). This keeps competition close, extends play, can feel unfair.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Neither is inherently good or bad. The question is what experience you want to create.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Human Random vs. Computer Random</h2>
        
        <p>
          Humans are bad at perceiving true randomness. A truly random sequence often 
          looks "streaky" to humans, who expect more alternation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Computer random is mathematically fair. But it can feel unfair to players. 
          Three critical hits in a row is possible and will happen eventually. 
          When it happens to players, they feel cheated.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Many videogames use weighted randomness that feels more fair to humans 
          while sacrificing mathematical purity. This is a design choice, not a bug.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Player Fair vs. Computer Fair</h2>
        
        <p>
          Related: what feels fair to the player is not always what is mathematically fair.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Coyote time (letting players jump slightly after leaving a platform) is not 
          "fair" in a strict sense. The player is jumping from midair. But it feels fair 
          because it matches player intention.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Input buffering (remembering inputs for a grace period) is not "fair" either. 
          But it makes the videogame feel responsive rather than demanding frame-perfect precision.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Good videogame design often prioritizes player-fair over computer-fair. 
          The goal is an experience that feels right, not one that is mathematically pure.
        </p>
