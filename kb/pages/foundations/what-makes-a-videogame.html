        <h1>What Makes a Videogame</h1>
        
        <p class="lead">
          Videogames are a medium of action. They are played, not just watched or read.
        </p>

        <h2>The Magic Circle (And Why It Doesn't Matter Much Here)</h2>
        
        <p>
          You may have heard of the "magic circle," a concept from Johan Huizinga describing the boundary 
          between play and ordinary life. It's a useful theoretical device for thinking about play in general.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But for our purposes, it doesn't especially matter. We're not here to debate definitions of play 
          or where the boundary between videogame and not-videogame lies. We're here to understand 
          videogames as they exist, as they are experienced, as they are made.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Videogames Are Their Own Medium</h2>
        
        <p>
          Videogames borrow from cinema, music, literature, theatre, visual art. But they are not 
          reducible to any of these. What makes videogames distinct is that the player acts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A film asks you to watch. A book asks you to read. A videogame asks you to do.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This doing can be pressing buttons, making choices, moving through space, or even 
          choosing to be still. But the player is always implicated in what happens. 
          The videogame cannot exist without being played.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Not Just Product, Not Just Art</h2>
        
        <p>
          Videogames are often framed as products (entertainment, consumer goods) or as art 
          (expressive works, cultural artifacts). Both framings capture something true.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But videogames are neither just products nor just art. They are both and neither. 
          The creations that take full advantage of the medium understand this. They don't 
          pick one framing and ignore the other. They embrace the full complexity of what 
          videogames are.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>What We Study</h2>
        
        <p>
          In VG101, we study videogames as they are. We analyze the <a href="../framework/gesture.html">Gesture</a>, 
          the surface area of contact between player and videogame. We trace 
          <a href="../framework/aesthetic-heritage.html">Aesthetic Heritage</a>, where design choices come from. 
          We examine <a href="../framework/permissions.html">Permissions</a>, what the system allows and forbids.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We do this not to reduce videogames to formulas, but to develop vocabulary for 
          what we experience. The goal is to play with more awareness, analyze with more precision, 
          and create with more intention.
        </p>
