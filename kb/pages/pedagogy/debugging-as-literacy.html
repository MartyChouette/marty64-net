        <h1>Debugging as Literacy</h1>
<strong>Debugging</strong> isn't just fixing code. It's a mode of thinking — a literacy in the root sense: the ability to read, understand, and respond to systems.
Treating debugging as literacy changes how we teach code in videogame design.
<hr>
<h2>The Conventional View</h2>
In CS education, debugging is remediation. You wrote a bug; now fix it. Debugging is failure recovery.
This framing makes debugging shameful. Students hide their bugs. They feel dumb when code doesn't work.
<hr>
<h2>The Literacy View</h2>
Debugging is <strong>reading.</strong> When code breaks, you read what it's actually doing (vs. what you intended). That reading skill transfers: you can read code you didn't write, read systems you didn't design, read behavior you didn't expect.
Debugging is <strong>inquiry.</strong> "Why doesn't this work?" is a research question. You form hypotheses, test them, revise. This is scientific thinking applied to systems.
Debugging is <strong>craft.</strong> Every craft has failure. Potters have collapsed pots. Writers have bad drafts. Debugging is normal, not shameful.
<hr>
<h2>Why This Matters for Videogame Design</h2>
Game designers who can't debug are dependent on engineers. They can't prototype. They can't tweak feel. They can't understand why their design isn't working.
Game designers who <em>can</em> debug have:
- <strong>Prototyping independence:</strong> Build rough versions without waiting for engineers
- <strong>Feel intuition:</strong> Tweak values, see results, iterate fast
- <strong>System literacy:</strong> Understand how videogame systems actually work
- <strong>Communication ability:</strong> Talk to engineers in their language
You don't need to be a great programmer. You need to be a competent debugger.
<hr>
<h2>Teaching Debugging</h2>
<h3>Normalize Failure</h3>
Code not working isn't failure — it's the normal state. Nobody writes perfect code first try. Professional developers spend most of their time debugging.
<h3>Read Before Fix</h3>
Before changing anything, understand what's happening. Read the error message. Read the code. Articulate (in words) what you think is wrong.
<h3>One Change at a Time</h3>
Change one thing, test, repeat. If you change five things and it works, you don't know which change fixed it.
<h3>Print Statements Are Your Friend</h3>
The simplest debugging tool: print the value. See what's actually happening, not what you think is happening.
<h3>Rubber Duck Debugging</h3>
Explain the code to someone (or something — a rubber duck). The act of articulating often reveals the bug.
<h3>Use the Error Message</h3>
Error messages tell you something. Read them. They're not random noise.
<hr>
<h2>The Code Bank and Debugging</h2>
The Code Bank scaffolds are designed for <strong>reading and modification</strong>, not just execution.
When a scaffold doesn't produce the feel you want:
1. <strong>Read</strong> the scaffold code
2. <strong>Identify</strong> which variable controls the aspect you want to change
3. <strong>Hypothesize</strong> what changing it will do
4. <strong>Test</strong> by changing and running
5. <strong>Iterate</strong> until it feels right
This is debugging as design process.
<hr>
<h2>Debugging Without Coding</h2>
The debugging mindset applies beyond code:
<strong>Debugging a design:</strong> Something doesn't work. Why? Form hypothesis. Test. Revise.
<strong>Debugging feedback:</strong> Playtesters report frustration. Where? Why? What's the root cause?
<strong>Debugging communication:</strong> Message isn't landing. What's being misunderstood? Where's the gap?
The skill transfers. Learning to debug code teaches you to debug everything.

<h2>Teaching Notes</h2>
I introduce debugging explicitly in <strong>Week 2</strong>, the first time students use the Code Bank. We talk about debugging <em>before</em> they encounter bugs, to normalize it.
<strong>Key move:</strong> When students get stuck, don't give the answer. Guide them through debugging:
- "What's the error message say?"
- "What do you <em>think</em> is happening?"
- "How could you test that?"
This is slower. It's also where learning happens.
<strong>Exercise: Intentional Bugs</strong>
Give students code with intentional bugs. Have them debug without seeing the working version. Then discuss: how did you find it? What strategies did you use?
<strong>Exercise: Explain the Code</strong>
Students present someone else's Code Bank scaffold to the class. Forces reading and articulating unfamiliar code.
<strong>Assessment:</strong> I assess debugging process, not just outcome. "How did you approach the problem?" matters as much as "did you fix it?"

<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
<strong>Key influences:</strong>
<strong>Seymour Papert</strong> — <em>Mindstorms</em>. The idea that programming teaches thinking. Debugging is the thinking.
<strong>Brian Cantwell Smith</strong> — <em>On the Origin of Objects</em>. Computational thinking as a distinct mode of understanding.
<strong>Annette Vee</strong> — <em>Coding Literacy</em>. The argument for coding as a form of literacy, not just a technical skill.
<strong>What I'm taking:</strong>
The literacy frame fundamentally changes the pedagogical stance. If debugging is literacy, it's a core skill, not a remedial one.
<strong>What I'm resisting:</strong>
<strong>The "debugging is for engineers" view.</strong> Designers debug too. Just differently.
<strong>The shame around failure.</strong> CS culture often makes bugs shameful. That's counterproductive.
<strong>Unresolved questions:</strong>
- How much debugging literacy is enough for designers? They don't need to be engineers. Where's the line?
- Does debugging literacy develop specific cognitive skills? The claim that "coding teaches thinking" is contested.
- How do we assess debugging? It's process-oriented, hard to grade.
