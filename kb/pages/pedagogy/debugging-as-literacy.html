        <h1>Debugging as Literacy</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          <strong>Debugging</strong> isn't just fixing code. It's a mode of thinking - a literacy in the root sense:
          the ability to read, understand, and respond to systems. Treating debugging as literacy changes how we teach
          code in videogame design.
        </p>

          <div class="register-header" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('collapsed')">
            Practice <span class="register-label">— what you do</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>The Conventional View</h3>
            <p>
              In CS education, debugging is remediation. You wrote a bug; now fix it. Debugging is failure recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              This framing makes debugging shameful. Students hide their bugs. They feel dumb when code doesn't work.
            </p>

            <h3>The Literacy View</h3>
            <p>
              Debugging is <strong>reading.</strong> When code breaks, you read what it's actually doing
              (vs. what you intended). That reading skill transfers: you can read code you didn't write,
              read systems you didn't design, read behavior you didn't expect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Debugging is <strong>inquiry.</strong> "Why doesn't this work?" is a research question.
              You form hypotheses, test them, revise. This is scientific thinking applied to systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Debugging is <strong>craft.</strong> Every craft has failure. Potters have collapsed pots.
              Writers have bad drafts. Debugging is normal, not shameful.
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Matters for Videogame Design</h3>
            <p>
              Videogame designers who can't debug are dependent on engineers. They can't prototype.
              They can't tweak feel. They can't understand why their design isn't working.
            </p>
            <p>Videogame designers who <em>can</em> debug have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Prototyping independence:</strong> Build rough versions without waiting for engineers</li>
              <li><strong>Feel intuition:</strong> Tweak values, see results, iterate fast</li>
              <li><strong>System literacy:</strong> Understand how videogame systems actually work</li>
              <li><strong>Communication ability:</strong> Talk to engineers in their language</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You don't need to be a great programmer. You need to be a competent debugger.</p>

            <h3>Teaching Debugging</h3>

            <h4>Normalize Failure</h4>
            <p>
              Code not working isn't failure - it's the normal state. Nobody writes perfect code first try.
              Professional developers spend most of their time debugging.
            </p>

            <h4>Read Before Fix</h4>
            <p>
              Before changing anything, understand what's happening. Read the error message. Read the code.
              Articulate (in words) what you think is wrong.
            </p>

            <h4>One Change at a Time</h4>
            <p>
              Change one thing, test, repeat. If you change five things and it works,
              you don't know which change fixed it.
            </p>

            <h4>Print Statements Are Your Friend</h4>
            <p>
              The simplest debugging tool: print the value. See what's actually happening,
              not what you think is happening.
            </p>

            <h4>Rubber Duck Debugging</h4>
            <p>
              Explain the code to someone (or something - a rubber duck).
              The act of articulating often reveals the bug.
            </p>

            <h4>Use the Error Message</h4>
            <p>
              Error messages tell you something. Read them. They're not random noise.
            </p>

            <h3>The Code Bank and Debugging</h3>
            <p>
              The Code Bank scaffolds are designed for <strong>reading and modification</strong>, not just execution.
            </p>
            <p>When a scaffold doesn't produce the feel you want:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Read</strong> the scaffold code</li>
              <li><strong>Identify</strong> which variable controls the aspect you want to change</li>
              <li><strong>Hypothesize</strong> what changing it will do</li>
              <li><strong>Test</strong> by changing and running</li>
              <li><strong>Iterate</strong> until it feels right</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is debugging as design process.</p>

            <h3>Debugging Without Coding</h3>
            <p>The debugging mindset applies beyond code:</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Debugging a design:</strong> Something doesn't work. Why? Form hypothesis. Test. Revise.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Debugging feedback:</strong> Playtesters report frustration. Where? Why? What's the root cause?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Debugging communication:</strong> Message isn't landing. What's being misunderstood? Where's the gap?
            </p>
            <p>The skill transfers. Learning to debug code teaches you to debug everything.</p>

            Craft <span class="register-label">— for educators</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Teaching Notes</h3>
            <p>
              I introduce debugging explicitly in <strong>Week 2</strong>, the first time students use the Code Bank.
              We talk about debugging <em>before</em> they encounter bugs, to normalize it.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Move</h3>
            <p>When students get stuck, don't give the answer. Guide them through debugging:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"What's the error message say?"</li>
              <li>"What do you <em>think</em> is happening?"</li>
              <li>"How could you test that?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is slower. It's also where learning happens.</p>

            <h3>Exercise: Intentional Bugs</h3>
            <p>
              Give students code with intentional bugs. Have them debug without seeing the working version.
              Then discuss: how did you find it? What strategies did you use?
            </p>

            <h3>Exercise: Explain the Code</h3>
            <p>
              Students present someone else's Code Bank scaffold to the class.
              Forces reading and articulating unfamiliar code.
            </p>

            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              I assess debugging process, not just outcome. "How did you approach the problem?"
              matters as much as "did you fix it?"
            </p>

            <h3>Common Challenges</h3>
            <p><strong>Students want to be told the answer:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Resist. The learning is in the process. Give hints, not solutions.
              Ask questions that lead them to discover the bug themselves.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Students make random changes hoping something works:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Stop them. Require articulation before action. "Before you change anything,
              tell me what you think is wrong and why this change will fix it."
            </p>

            <p><strong>Students are ashamed of bugs:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Share your own bugs. Show professional code with bugs.
              Make it clear that bugs are normal, not a sign of incompetence.
            </p>

            <h3>Theoretical Background</h3>

            <h4>Key Influences</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Seymour Papert</strong>: <em>Mindstorms</em>. The idea that programming teaches thinking.
              Debugging is the thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Brian Cantwell Smith</strong>: <em>On the Origin of Objects</em>.
              Computational thinking as a distinct mode of understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Annette Vee</strong>: <em>Coding Literacy</em>.
              The argument for coding as a form of literacy, not just a technical skill.
            </p>

            <h3>What I'm Taking</h3>
            <p>
              The literacy frame fundamentally changes the pedagogical stance.
              If debugging is literacy, it's a core skill, not a remedial one.
            </p>

            <h3>What I'm Resisting</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The "debugging is for engineers" view.</strong> Designers debug too. Just differently.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The shame around failure.</strong> CS culture often makes bugs shameful. That's counterproductive.
            </p>

            <h3>Unresolved Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How much debugging literacy is enough for designers? They don't need to be engineers. Where's the line?</li>
              <li>Does debugging literacy develop specific cognitive skills? The claim that "coding teaches thinking" is contested.</li>
              <li>How do we assess debugging? It's process-oriented, hard to grade.</li>
            </ul>
