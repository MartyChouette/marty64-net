        <h1>Code as Material</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          Code is a material. Like clay or paint, it has properties, resistances, and possibilities.
          Treating code as material - rather than as instruction or logic - changes how designers relate to implementation.
        </p>

        <!-- PRACTICE REGISTER -->
        <div class="register register--practice">
          <div class="register-header" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('collapsed')">
            Practice <span class="register-label">- what you do</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>The Conventional View</h3>
            <p>
              In traditional education, code is treated as <strong>instruction</strong>: you tell the computer what to do, it does it.
              Code is a means to an end - the end being the running program.
            </p>
            <p>
              This frames code as transparent. You think about what you want; code makes it happen.
              The code itself is irrelevant; only the result matters.
            </p>

            <h3>The Material View</h3>
            <p>
              In the material view, code has its own properties - like clay, wood, or paint.
              You work <em>with</em> it, not just through it. It pushes back. It suggests possibilities.
              It resists certain things and enables others.
            </p>

            <h4>Properties</h4>
            <p>Code has inherent properties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>It runs:</strong> Unlike a sketch, code executes. You can feel it.</li>
              <li><strong>It's exact:</strong> No ambiguity. 0.5 is not "about half."</li>
              <li><strong>It's repeatable:</strong> Same input, same output (usually). You can iterate precisely.</li>
              <li><strong>It's modular:</strong> Pieces can be combined, separated, reused.</li>
              <li><strong>It's fragile:</strong> Small changes can break everything. Syntax matters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Resistances</h4>
            <p>Code resists certain things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Vagueness ("make it feel good" isn't code)</li>
              <li>Simultaneity (things happen in sequence, not at once)</li>
              <li>Continuous values (you pick a number; the material doesn't)</li>
              <li>Inconsistency (it does exactly what you said, even if you didn't mean it)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Possibilities</h4>
            <p>Code enables things other materials can't:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Instant variation (change a number, see different behavior)</li>
              <li>Parametric design (expose values, make them tunable)</li>
              <li>Interactivity (the material responds to input)</li>
              <li>Reproduction (copy infinitely, share globally)</li>
              <li>Combination (stack systems on systems)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What This Changes</h3>

            <h4>Design Through Implementation</h4>
            <p>
              If code is material, you design <em>through</em> implementation, not before it.
              You discover possibilities by working with the material.
              A painter doesn't fully plan the painting before touching canvas; a designer doesn't fully plan the feel before touching code.
            </p>

            <h4>Prototyping as Sketching</h4>
            <p>
              Code prototypes are sketches in material. Rough, exploratory, meant to be thrown away.
              Like a sculptor's maquette, the prototype reveals what the material can do.
            </p>

            <h4>Feel Is Found</h4>
            <p>
              <a href="../framework/gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a> emerges from the code.
              You can imagine how a jump should feel, but the actual feel comes from gravity values,
              jump velocities, frame timing. The code gives you the feel; you refine it.
            </p>

            <h4>Parameters Are Handles</h4>
            <p>
              Good code exposes parameters - handles you can grab to change the behavior.
              The Code Bank scaffolds are designed this way: exposed variables at the top,
              tunable without understanding the implementation.
            </p>

            <h3>The Code Bank as Material Library</h3>
            <p>
              The <a href="../code-bank/index.html">Code Bank</a> provides pre-shaped materials.
              Like buying lumber instead of felling trees, or using premixed paint instead of grinding pigments.
            </p>
            <p>
              You're not cheating by using scaffolds. You're starting with refined material
              so you can focus on design decisions, not implementation details.
            </p>
            <p>Use scaffolds to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Get something running fast</li>
              <li>Feel the behavior before deciding if it's right</li>
              <li>Tune parameters to find the feel you want</li>
              <li>Learn by reading working code</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Knowing vs. Feeling</h3>
            <p>
              Knowing what you want is not the same as feeling it.
              "I want a floaty jump" is knowledge. The actual floaty jump - the gravity, the hang time,
              the landing - is feel. Code makes the jump real. Then you react to the real thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why prototyping matters. You don't know if your idea works until you feel it in material form.
            </p>

            <h3>Exercise: Material Exploration</h3>
            <p>Take any Code Bank scaffold. Don't try to make anything specific. Instead:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Change every exposed variable to see what it does</li>
              <li>Push values to extremes (gravity = 10000? gravity = 0.1?)</li>
              <li>Note which changes produce interesting behaviors</li>
              <li>Find a feel you didn't expect but like</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is material exploration - discovery through manipulation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

            <h3>Why Teach This</h3>
            <p>
              The "code as instruction" framing makes students afraid of code.
              It's abstract, logical, demanding. You have to know exactly what you want before you start.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "code as material" framing invites exploration.
              You don't need to know what you're making - you need to start making and see what happens.
              This is how artists work. It's less intimidating.
            </p>

            <h3>Introducing the Concept</h3>
            <p>
              We introduce "code as material" in Week 1, before any coding.
              We talk about other materials: clay, paint, wood, fabric.
              What are their properties? What do they resist? What do they enable?
            </p>
            <p>
              Then: code is the same. It has properties. We're going to learn them by working with the material.
            </p>

            <h3>Scaffolds as Entry Point</h3>
            <p>
              The Code Bank scaffolds let students work with code-as-material without writing code from scratch.
              They start by tuning, then modifying, then eventually building.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is how apprentices learn crafts: start with prepared materials,
              focus on one skill at a time, gradually take on more of the process.
            </p>

            <h3>Common Challenges</h3>

            <p><strong>"I don't know what values to use":</strong></p>
            <p>
              Good. That's the point. You find them by trying. Start somewhere. See what it feels like.
              Adjust. The material tells you when you're close.
            </p>

            <p><strong>"I want to do something the scaffold doesn't support":</strong></p>
            <p>
              Perfect. This is when you start modifying the scaffold - or writing new code.
              The material is telling you it wants to grow. Follow it.
            </p>

            <p><strong>"The code broke and I don't know why":</strong></p>
            <p>
              This is <a href="debugging-as-literacy.html">debugging</a>. The material pushed back.
              Now you read it to understand what happened.
            </p>

            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              Assess process, not just product. Did the student explore the material?
              Did they discover something unexpected? Can they articulate what the code does and why?
            </p>
            <p>
              The material exploration exercise above works as an assessment:
              document what you found by manipulating the material.

            <h3>Theoretical Background</h3>

            <h4>Key Influences</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Donald Schon</strong>: <em>The Reflective Practitioner</em>. Designing as a conversation with materials.
              The designer proposes; the material responds; the designer adjusts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Seymour Papert</strong>: <em>Mindstorms</em>. Constructionism - learning by building.
              The computer as a material for thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Richard Sennett</strong>: <em>The Craftsman</em>. Material engagement as a form of thought.
              The hand and the head are not separate.
            </p>

            <h3>The Phenomenology of Materials</h3>
            <p>
              Every material has a phenomenology - a way it presents itself to the person working with it.
              Wood has grain. Clay has plasticity. Paint has viscosity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Code's phenomenology includes: instantness (changes appear immediately), precision (exact values),
              fragility (syntax errors break everything), and depth (layers of abstraction).
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning a material means learning its phenomenology - how it feels to work with,
              what it wants to do, where it resists.
            </p>

            <h3>What We're Taking</h3>
            <p>
              The insight that design happens <em>in dialogue with material</em>, not before touching it.
              This licenses exploration, reduces the pressure to "know what you want" in advance,
              and positions prototyping as central to design.
            </p>

            <h3>What We're Resisting</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The "code is just a tool" view:</strong> Tools are extensions of intention.
              Materials have their own agency. Code shapes design, not just executes it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The "design documents first" approach:</strong> Documents have their place,
              but they're not design. The design is in the material. Docs are plans; material is reality.
            </p>

            <h3>Unresolved Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How much should designers know about the material's internal structure? You can work with clay without knowing chemistry - but is code the same?</li>
              <li>At what point does "material exploration" become "random messing around"? How do we scaffold productive exploration?</li>
              <li>Does the material metaphor work for non-programmers? Or does it require enough code literacy to "feel" the material?</li>
            </ul>
