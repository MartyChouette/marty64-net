        <h1>Accessibility as Craft</h1>
<strong>Accessibility</strong> isn't compliance. It isn't a checklist at the end of development. It's <strong>craft</strong> — a design skill that makes videogames playable by more people without compromising vision.
Treating accessibility as craft changes everything: when you consider it, how you implement it, and what you think it means.
<hr>
<h2>The Compliance View</h2>
Conventional accessibility work looks like:
- Subtitles
- Colorblind modes
- Remappable controls
- Done at the end
This is necessary. It's not sufficient.
The compliance view treats accessibility as <strong>adding features for disabled players.</strong> It's additive, late, often underfunded.
<hr>
<h2>The Craft View</h2>
The craft view sees accessibility as <strong>design quality.</strong> Accessible videogames are well-designed games.
- Clear visual hierarchy → good design AND readable for low vision
- Responsive controls → good feel AND usable for motor impairments
- Multiple difficulty options → respects player time AND enables more players
- Clear audio cues → good feedback AND playable without sight
Good design <em>is</em> accessible design. They're not separate goals.
<hr>
<h2>Why "Craft" Not "Feature"?</h2>
A <strong>feature</strong> is bolted on. It has a scope, a budget, a checkbox.
A <strong>craft</strong> is woven through. It's a way of thinking, not a deliverable.
Calling accessibility a craft means:
- It's considered from the start
- It's everyone's responsibility (not one specialist's)
- It's ongoing (not one release milestone)
- It's skilled work (not just implementation)
<hr>
<h2>Core Accessibility Domains</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Domain</th><th>What it addresses</th><th>Craft questions</th>
</tr></thead><tbody>
</tr>
</tr></thead><tbody>
</tr>
</tr></thead><tbody>
</tbody></table>
<p><tr> <td><strong>Visual</strong></td><td>Low vision, blindness, colorblindness</td><td>Is the screen readable at a glance? Does color alone convey information?</td> <thead><tr> <th><strong>Auditory</strong></th><th>Deafness, hard of hearing</th><th>Is audio information redundantly presented? Are subtitles good?</th> <tr> <td><strong>Motor</strong></td><td>Limited mobility, precision, fatigue</td><td>Are controls flexible? Are time-sensitive moments adjustable?</td> <thead><tr> <th><strong>Cognitive</strong></th><th>Learning differences, attention, memory</th><th>Is information clearly presented? Can pace be controlled?</th></p>
<p>Every player exists on spectrums in all four domains. "Disabled" isn't a binary.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Accessibility as Design Constraint</h2>
Constraints drive creativity. Accessibility constraints are design constraints.
"This videogame must be playable with one hand" isn't a limitation — it's a prompt. What designs emerge from that constraint?
- <em>Celeste</em>'s assist mode emerged from thinking about who gets to finish games
- <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>'s accessibility options were designed alongside core mechanics
- <em>Hades</em>'s "God Mode" respects player time without removing challenge
These aren't compromises. They're design innovations.
<hr>
<h2>Common Objections (And Responses)</h2>
<strong>"Accessibility undermines artistic vision."</strong>
Does difficulty selection undermine vision? Does subtitles undermine vision? Accessibility is player options, not mandate. The core experience is still there.
<strong>"Our audience doesn't need it."</strong>
Your audience includes disabled players. 20-25% of people have some form of disability. You just don't see them because they can't play your game.
<strong>"We don't have the budget."</strong>
Accessibility built from the start costs less than accessibility retrofitted. The cheapest accessibility is considered design.
<strong>"Some videogames are meant to be hard."</strong>
Hard <em>for whom</em>? A timing-based videogame is harder for someone with motor impairments. Is that the challenge you intended? <em>Celeste</em> is hard AND accessible.
<hr>
<h2>Practical Accessibility Craft</h2>
<h3>Visual</h3>
- Don't rely on color alone (shape, pattern, position as redundant cues)
- Scalable text
- High contrast option
- Screen reader support for menus
<h3>Auditory</h3>
- Subtitles (good ones: speaker identification, sound effects)
- Visual cues for important sounds
- Adjustable audio channels
<h3>Motor</h3>
- Remappable controls
- Toggle vs. hold options
- Adjustable timing windows
- One-handed control schemes
<h3>Cognitive</h3>
- Clear objectives
- Adjustable speed/pace
- Save anywhere
- Minimize memory load
<hr>
<h2>Accessibility in VG101</h2>
I integrate accessibility throughout the course, not as a single topic:
- <strong>Week 5 (Feedback & Readability):</strong> Feedback channels as accessibility — if all feedback is audio, deaf players are excluded
- <strong>Week 7 (Feel Experiment):</strong> Adjust timing variables. How does changing them change who can play?
- <strong>Case studies:</strong> Analyze how videogames handle accessibility
<strong>Key message:</strong> Accessibility isn't extra. It's part of craft.

<h2>Teaching Notes</h2>
Accessibility can feel like a checklist or like a moral imperative. I try to frame it as <em>interesting design work</em>.
<strong>Exercise: Accessibility Audit</strong>
Audit a game's accessibility features. What's there? What's missing? What would it take to improve? How would those improvements affect the core design?
<strong>Exercise: Constraint Design</strong>
Design a videogame concept around an accessibility constraint: playable with no audio, playable with one button, playable with no text. What emerges?
<strong>Guest speakers:</strong> I bring in disabled players and accessibility consultants. Students hear directly from people affected.
<strong>Danger:</strong> Accessibility can become performative ("we care about disabled people") without substance. Push for <em>specific</em> craft work.

<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
<strong>Key influences:</strong>
<strong>Ian Hamilton</strong> — Accessibility specialist. His work on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is a reference point.
<strong>Cherry Thompson / AbleGamers</strong> — Advocacy and practical guidance.
<strong>Universal Design</strong> — Architecture's "design for all" principle. Videogames inherit this.
<strong>What I'm taking:</strong>
The "curb cut effect": accessibility features benefit everyone. Curb cuts help wheelchairs, but also strollers, luggage, bikes. Accessibility is good design.
<strong>What I'm resisting:</strong>
<strong>The charity model:</strong> "Let's help the disabled." Accessibility isn't charity. It's design quality.
<strong>The minimum viable compliance:</strong> Checking boxes isn't craft.
<strong>Unresolved questions:</strong>
- Where's the line between accessibility and core design? Some argue certain experiences require certain abilities. I'm skeptical, but the debate exists.
- How do we handle accessibility in competitive games? If accessibility options change difficulty, what's fair in competitive contexts?
- Resource reality: accessibility is skilled work. How do small teams do it well?
