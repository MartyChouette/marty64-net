          Narrative embedded in the world itself - not told through cutscenes or dialogue, but discovered through exploration, observation, and inference.

            <h3>What Environmental Storytelling Is</h3>
            <p>
              A skeleton clutching a note. A child's room in an abandoned house. Scorch marks on a wall. The environment tells you what happened without <em>telling</em> you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Videogames have a unique capacity for spatial narrative. Unlike film, which controls exactly what you see, videogames let players <strong>move through</strong> story.
            </p>
            <p>This creates:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> The player finds the story rather than receiving it</li>
              <li><strong>Agency:</strong> The player chooses where to look, what to investigate</li>
              <li><strong>Immersion:</strong> Narrative feels embedded in the world, not layered on top</li>
              <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The player fills gaps, becomes co-author</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Environmental storytelling respects player intelligence. It shows rather than tells - and sometimes doesn't even show, just implies.</p>

            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p><strong>Found Objects:</strong> Items that imply history: a stuffed toy in a war zone, a wedding ring by a grave, a locked diary. Objects need context - a toy alone is just a toy. A toy next to small bones tells a story.</p>
            <p><strong>Spatial Arrangement:</strong> How objects relate in space: a chair facing a window, a table set for two with one plate untouched, a bed in a closet. Think about <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>. What was the scene before something happened?</p>
            <p><strong>Environmental Damage:</strong> What violence or time has done: bullet holes, bloodstains, collapsed ceilings, overgrown gardens. Damage tells you about forces. What could make this mark?</p>
            <p><strong>Contrast:</strong> Juxtaposition that creates meaning: a pristine room in a destroyed building, a child's drawing of violence, a celebration banner in a morgue. Contrast implies <em>break</em> - something changed.</p>
            <p><strong>Absence:</strong> What's missing: an empty picture frame, a gap in a row of trophies, a name scratched off a list. Absence requires establishment - you need to show what <em>should</em> be there.</p>

            <h3>Levels of Environmental Narrative</h3>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Level</th>
                  <th>What it tells</th>
                  <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>World history</strong></td>
                  <td>What happened before the player</td>
                  <td><em>Fallout</em>: the bombs fell, society collapsed</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Location history</strong></td>
                  <td>What happened in this place</td>
                  <td>This office was barricaded; someone lived here alone</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Character traces</strong></td>
                  <td>Who was here, what were they like</td>
                  <td>Love letters suggest a relationship</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Recent events</strong></td>
                  <td>What just happened</td>
                  <td>Warm coffee suggests someone left moments ago</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Player impact</strong></td>
                  <td>What the player caused</td>
                  <td>Returning to see consequences of your earlier choice</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>The richest environments layer multiple levels - the world's history, the location's story, the individual's life.</p>

            <h3>The Discovery Arc</h3>
            <p>Environmental storytelling has pacing, even without scripted events:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Initial confusion:</strong> Player enters a space, sees elements, doesn't yet understand</li>
              <li><strong>Accumulating details:</strong> Each discovered element adds context</li>
              <li><strong>Moment of understanding:</strong> The pieces click; the story crystallizes</li>
              <li><strong>Emotional response:</strong> Player feels the implications</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This arc requires <strong>restraint.</strong> If you explain everything immediately, there's no discovery. If you explain nothing, there's only confusion.</p>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Over-signposting:</strong> Highlighting every environmental detail ("Press X to examine") trains players not to look.</li>
              <li><strong>Under-signposting:</strong> Making crucial story elements invisible or missable without any guidance.</li>
              <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Environmental logic that breaks (food that doesn't decay, bodies that don't decompose) unless deliberately stylized.</li>
              <li><strong>Audio log dependency:</strong> Using environmental storytelling as an excuse for audio logs everywhere. Audio logs are exposition wearing exploration's clothes.</li>
              <li><strong>Dead ends:</strong> Environmental stories that have no resolution or relevance. A mysterious setup needs at least partial payoff.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exercise: Scene Forensics</h3>
            <p>Take an image of an environmental storytelling scene from <em>Gone Home</em>, <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, or <em>Dark Souls</em>. Ask:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What's the story here?</li>
              <li>What specific elements tell you that?</li>
              <li>What's left ambiguous?</li>
              <li>How would you break this if you changed one element?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Why Teach This</h3>
            <p>
              Environmental storytelling bridges <strong>Narrative Design</strong> and <strong>Level Design</strong> - it's where story becomes spatial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students often think of narrative as cutscenes or dialogue. This concept expands their understanding of how videogames can tell stories through their unique capacity for spatial exploration.
            </p>

            <h3>Environmental vs. Expository</h3>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Environmental</th>
                  <th>Expository</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Implied</td>
                  <td>Stated</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Discovered</td>
                  <td>Delivered</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Gaps require inference</td>
                  <td>Complete information</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Player interprets</td>
                  <td>Author interprets for player</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Easy to miss</td>
                  <td>Hard to miss</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Neither is superior. Expository narrative has its place. But environmental storytelling does something expository can't: it makes the player <em>detective</em>.</p>

            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p><strong>Exercise: Crime Scene Design</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students create a small environment (one room) that tells a story with zero text or dialogue. Classmates must "read" the scene and describe what happened.
            </p>
            <p>Debrief: What was communicated? What was missed? Where was interpretation different from intention?</p>
            <p><strong>Key concept:</strong> Environmental storytelling is <strong>design</strong>, not decoration. Every element is a choice that either contributes to the story or detracts from it.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Key Influences</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Henry Jenkins</strong> - "Game Design as Narrative Architecture." The foundational essay. Jenkins argues videogames are less like traditional stories and more like designed spaces that enable storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Don Carson</strong> - Disney Imagineer who articulated environmental storytelling for theme park design. Videogames inherited heavily from this tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Marie-Laure Ryan</strong> - Narrative theory applied to digital media. The distinction between "narrative" and "narrativity" - some videogames have embedded narrative, others have emergent narrativity.
            </p>

            <h3>What We're Taking</h3>
            <p>
              The spatial turn. Videogames tell stories <em>through</em> space in ways other media can't. Environmental storytelling isn't a workaround for lacking cutscenes - it's a native videogame capacity.
            </p>

            <h3>What We're Resisting</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The "games must have narrative" push:</strong> Not all videogames need environmental storytelling. <em>Tetris</em> isn't narratively impoverished; it's doing something else.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Environmental fetishism:</strong> The idea that environmental = good, expository = bad. Sometimes you need to <em>tell</em> the player something. The audio log is mocked because it's overused, not because it's inherently bad.
            </p>

            <h3>Unresolved Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How much authorial control should there be? <em>Dark Souls</em> is notoriously ambiguous - is that meaningful mystery or insufficiently designed? Different players have different answers.</li>
              <li>Can environmental storytelling work for character interiority? It's good at <em>what happened</em> but harder for <em>how it felt</em>. How do you environmentally tell an emotional story?</li>
              <li>What's the relationship between environmental storytelling and genre? Horror uses it extensively; does it work for comedy?</li>
            </ul>
