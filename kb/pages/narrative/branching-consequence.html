        <h1>Branching & Consequence</h1>
<strong>Branching</strong> is when player choices create different paths. <strong>Consequence</strong> is when those choices matter — when the path you took shapes what happens later.
Every choice-based videogame grapples with these: How much do choices diverge? How long do consequences echo? And crucially: how do you create the <em>feeling</em> of consequence when you can't actually build infinite permutations?
<hr>
<h2>The Illusion Problem</h2>
Players want their choices to matter. Developers have finite resources. This creates tension.
A videogame with 10 meaningful binary choices has 1,024 possible endings. That's unshippable. So designers cheat — and the good ones cheat well.
<strong>The goal isn't maximum branching. It's maximum <em>felt</em> consequence.</strong>
<hr>
<h2>Branching Structures</h2>
<h3>Linear with Flavor</h3>
The story goes one place, but dialogue and details change based on choices.
<pre><code>    ──●──●──●──●──●──●→ [One ending]
       ↑  ↑  ↑
     Different dialogue at each point
</code></pre>
<p><em>Example: Most RPGs with "good/evil" dialogue that don't actually change the plot</em></p>
<h3>Foldback (Bottleneck)</h3>
Paths diverge, then converge at key points before diverging again.
<pre><code>        ╱──●──╲
    ──●        ●──●──●→
        ╲──●──╱
</code></pre>
<p><em>Example: Mass Effect (many choices, but main story beats are fixed)</em></p>
<h3>Parallel Paths</h3>
Genuinely different routes that occasionally touch.
<pre><code>    ──●──●──●──●→
              ╲╱
    ──○──○──○──○→
</code></pre>
<p><em>Example: Silent Hill 2 (different endings based on accumulated behavior)</em></p>
<h3>Branching Tree</h3>
Exponential divergence. Expensive, rare.
<pre><code>           ╱●──●
      ╱──●
    ●      ╲●
      ╲──●──●
</code></pre>
<p><em>Example: Visual novels with many true routes</em></p>

<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Players often can't tell the difference between structural and cosmetic consequences — especially on a single playthrough. This is your ally.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Making Consequences Feel Real</h2>
<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>
Have the videogame recognize what the player did. An NPC mentions your earlier choice. The world shows a scar from your decision.
<em>"I heard about what you did in the village."</em> — This costs almost nothing and makes choices feel witnessed.
<h3>Delayed Callback</h3>
Reference an early choice late in the game. The longer the delay, the more impactful the callback.
<em>Mass Effect 2's suicide mission draws on choices made 40+ hours earlier.</em>
<h3>Irreversibility</h3>
Make some choices genuinely permanent. No save-scumming, no backsies.
<em>Undertale's Genocide route permanently marks your save file.</em>
<h3>Character Reaction</h3>
Have characters respond emotionally, not just informationally. Disappointment. Gratitude. Betrayal.
<em>Reactions make choices feel moral, not just strategic.</em>
<h3>Absence</h3>
Remove something. A character who dies is <em>gone</em>. A path not taken is closed.
<em>The most expensive consequence, but the most felt.</em>
<hr>
<h2>The False Choice Problem</h2>
A <strong>false choice</strong> is one where both options lead to the same outcome.
False choices aren't always bad — they can let players express themselves without ballooning scope. But players resent them when they feel deceived.
<strong>Good false choice:</strong> Dialogue options that express your character's personality without changing plot
<strong>Bad false choice:</strong> "Save the village or save the city" where both end up saved anyway
The difference is expectation. If a choice <em>seems</em> significant, it needs at least cosmetic consequence.
<hr>

<p><em>Authored: Mass Effect's loyalty missions affecting the ending</em> <em>Emergent: Dwarf Fortress's fortress collapsing from a butterfly effect of decisions</em></p>
<p>Both are valuable. Authored consequence feels intentional; emergent consequence feels personal.</p>

<h2>Teaching Notes</h2>
Branching & Consequence is where narrative design meets systems design. Choices are systems; consequences are feedback.
<strong>The key insight:</strong> Consequence is about <em>feeling</em>, not <em>scope</em>. Students often think more branching = better. Show them how smaller videogames create powerful consequences with minimal divergence.
<strong>Exercise: Consequence Mapping</strong>
Take a choice from a published game. Map:
1. What choices does the player have?
2. What immediate consequences follow?
3. What delayed consequences appear?
4. How much does the content actually diverge?
Often, the perceived divergence far exceeds the actual divergence. That's good design.
<strong>Exercise: Minimal Viable Branch</strong>
Students design a 3-choice sequence where each choice has a consequence, but total content is limited to 5 scenes. Forces creative use of callbacks, acknowledgments, and cosmetic variation.
<strong>Warning:</strong> Students often design unsustainable branch trees. Make them <em>count</em> their nodes before building.

<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
Branching & Consequence sits at the intersection of narratology, videogame studies, and production reality.
<strong>Key influences:</strong>
<strong>Sam Barlow</strong> — Designer of <em>Her Story</em> and <em>Immortality</em>. His work explores non-linear discovery rather than branching choices. The player constructs the story from fragments.
<strong>Emily Short</strong> — Interactive fiction pioneer. Her work on conversation systems and quality-based narrative (Failbetter's StoryNexus) offers alternatives to simple branching.
<strong>Chris Gardiner</strong> — Failbetter Games. "Quality-based narrative" uses accumulating stats rather than branch points. Your history is a set of qualities, not a tree.
<strong>What I'm taking:</strong>
The reframe from "branch points" to "consequence systems." Stop thinking about Y-shaped paths and start thinking about how player history is tracked and surfaced.
<strong>What I'm resisting:</strong>
<strong>Branch fetishism:</strong> The assumption that more branching = better game. Some of the best narrative videogames (<em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em>) are almost entirely linear.
<strong>The "player control" ideology:</strong> The idea that players should control the story. Sometimes the most powerful experiences come from <em>lack</em> of control — from being complicit in something you couldn't prevent.
<strong>Unresolved questions:</strong>
- How do we balance player agency with authored meaning? If the player can choose anything, how does the author say anything?
- Is consequence even possible in a save/reload paradigm? Can choices "really" matter when the player can undo them?
- What's the relationship between branching and replayability? Some videogames are better experienced once; does branching serve them?
