            <h3>Harmony vs. Dissonance</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Ludonarrative harmony</strong> is when mechanics and narrative point the same direction. What you do <em>is</em> what the story is about.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Ludonarrative dissonance</strong> is when they contradict: the story says one thing, the gameplay says another.
            </p>

            <h3>The Classic Dissonance</h3>
            <p>
              <em>Uncharted</em>'s Nathan Drake is a likable everyman in cutscenes. In gameplay, he kills hundreds of people without hesitation or consequence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story says: charming adventurer.<br>
              The gameplay says: mass murderer.
            </p>
            <p>This contradiction is ludonarrative dissonance. The two channels of meaning are out of sync.</p>

            <h3>Harmony in Practice</h3>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Videogame</th>
                  <th>How mechanics reinforce narrative</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><em>Journey</em></td>
                  <td>Cooperation mechanics support theme of connection</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em></td>
                  <td>Control scheme embodies the relationship</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><em>Papers, Please</em></td>
                  <td>Bureaucratic mechanics create complicity</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><em>Celeste</em></td>
                  <td>Difficulty mechanics mirror struggle with mental health</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></td>
                  <td>Mounting and stabbing creates ambivalence about killing</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>In each case, the <em>feeling</em> of playing matches the <em>meaning</em> of the story.</p>

            <h3>Three Relationships</h3>
            <p><strong>Harmony:</strong> Mechanics and narrative point the same direction. <em>Journey</em>: You walk toward a mountain. You meet strangers. You help each other. The mechanics ARE the theme.</p>
            <p><strong>Dissonance:</strong> Mechanics and narrative contradict. <em>BioShock</em>: "A man chooses, a slave obeys" - but you have no choice but to follow the objective markers.</p>
            <p><strong>Productive Tension:</strong> The contradiction is the point. <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em>: You play a shooter, but the videogame wants you to feel sick about shooting. The dissonance indicts the genre.</p>

            <h3>Achieving Harmony</h3>
            <p><strong>Start with verbs:</strong> What will the player <em>do</em> most? That's what your videogame is about, regardless of your narrative intentions. Design story to match.</p>
            <p><strong>Audit your mechanics:</strong> For each mechanic, ask: what does this <em>say</em>? A regenerating health system says "damage is temporary." A permanent death system says "death is final." Do those statements match your story?</p>
            <p><strong>Use mechanics for theme:</strong> Don't just tell a story about loss - make the player lose something. Don't just tell a story about connection - make the player depend on someone.</p>
            <p><strong>Accept constraints:</strong> If your videogame is a shooter, it's about shooting. You can critique shooting (Spec Ops), but you can't pretend you're not making a videogame about shooting.</p>

            <h3>Exercise: Dissonance Hunt</h3>
            <p>Play a videogame and identify every instance of ludonarrative dissonance you can find. Then classify each: accidental, harmful, or productive?</p>

            Craft <span class="register-label">- for educators</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Why Teach This</h3>
            <p>
              The core provocation: "Your mechanics are your story. If they contradict your cutscenes, your mechanics win."
            </p>
            <p>
              Students often want to add narrative to justify mechanics they've already designed. This concept pushes them to ask whether the mechanics <em>should</em> be what they are.
            </p>

            <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
            <p><strong>"All dissonance is bad"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Dissonance is only a problem when it's accidental - when the designer didn't notice the contradiction. (Well, a problem for the videogame designer's artistic intent; for players it's just a new <a href="../framework/gesture.html" class="term">gesture</a>!) Dissonance can be a very meaningful and persuasive tool when it's intentional - it doesn't even have to be a contradiction that makes you uncomfortable to be dissonance, though that is always cool.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest example always gone to is <em>BioShock</em> (from Clint Hocking's 2007 blog post that coined the term as a derogatory). The narrative plot is about free will and control, but the videogame is fairly rigid about things in the end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another famous example is <em>Uncharted</em>. When applying the idea of ludonarrative dissonance, dashing Nathan Drake is a qualified genocidal force of nature - a player will murder (in self-defense?) 585 to 1,130 people (depending on play style) in his first outing, <em>Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can also be the gap between cutscene and play scene. <em>Halo</em> had a player experience design theory of BYOG (Bring Your Own Gun) - whatever gun you had equipped in play, Bungie wanted it to be in the cutscenes. They wanted you to experience "choices matter" in a very different context than we usually experience.
            </p>

            <p><strong>"Perfect harmony is always the goal"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Tension, contradiction, and discomfort are valid artistic choices. <em>Mario</em> rescues Peach through murdering ~143 Goombas in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>; no one has ever cared. Context matters.
            </p>

            <h3>The "Fun" Problem</h3>
            <p>Sometimes mechanics are fun but thematically wrong. <em>Uncharted</em>'s shooting is satisfying - that's the problem. If it weren't fun, the dissonance wouldn't exist.</p>
            <p>Approaches:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lean into fun:</strong> Accept that your videogame is partly power fantasy. Don't pretend otherwise in cutscenes.</li>
              <li><strong>Make the theme fun:</strong> Design mechanics where the thematic action IS the satisfying one. <em>Portal</em>'s puzzle-solving is both fun and thematically coherent.</li>
              <li><strong>Make fun uncomfortable:</strong> Design mechanics that are satisfying and then make you feel bad about that satisfaction (<em>Spec Ops</em>, <em>Undertale</em>).</li>
              <li><strong>Reduce fun dissonance:</strong> If violence is thematically weighty, make combat difficult, costly, or rare.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p><strong>Exercise: Harmony Redesign</strong></p>
            <p>
              Take a videogame with clear dissonance. Redesign EITHER the narrative to match the mechanics OR the mechanics to match the narrative. What's lost in each direction?

          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Origin of the Term</h3>
            <p>
              "Ludonarrative dissonance" was coined by Clint Hocking in a 2007 blog post about <em>BioShock</em>. It became one of the most-used (and sometimes overused) terms in videogame criticism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hocking's original critique remains sharp: <em>BioShock</em> asks you to question blind obedience while the gameplay requires blind obedience to objective markers.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Influences</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Clint Hocking</strong> - The original formulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Ian Bogost</strong> - Procedural rhetoric provides the theoretical backing: videogames make arguments through mechanics.
            </p>

            <h3>What We're Taking</h3>
            <p>
              The core insight that mechanics <em>mean something</em>, and that meaning should be in dialogue with explicit narrative. This is basic but often ignored.
            </p>

            <h3>What We're Resisting</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Dissonance policing:</strong> The idea that all dissonance is bad. Sometimes it's fine. Context matters more than consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The harmony fetish:</strong> The idea that perfect harmony is always the goal. Tension, contradiction, and discomfort are valid artistic choices.
            </p>

            <h3>Unresolved Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How much dissonance can players tolerate before it breaks immersion?</li>
              <li>Is dissonance a Western critical concern? Do players from different traditions parse the ludo/narrative relationship differently?</li>
              <li>Can systemic videogames (<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, <em>Rimworld</em>) have ludonarrative dissonance if they have no authored narrative?</li>
            </ul>
