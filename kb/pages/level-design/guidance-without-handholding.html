        <h1>Guidance Without Hand-Holding</h1>
        <p>The best videogames teach you everything you need without making you feel taught. You discover; you're not told. You figure it out; you're not shown the answer.</p>
        <p>This is <strong>guidance without hand-holding</strong>: creating conditions for learning without removing the satisfaction of learning.</p>

        <div class="register register--practice">
          <div class="register-header" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('collapsed')">
            Practice <span class="register-label">- what you do</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>The Hand-Holding Problem</h3>
            <p>Hand-holding damages the player experience:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Removes discovery:</strong> If the videogame tells you where the secret is, it's not a secret</li>
              <li><strong>Undercuts mastery:</strong> If the solution is given, solving it isn't an achievement</li>
              <li><strong>Breaks immersion:</strong> Tutorial prompts remind you you're playing a videogame</li>
              <li><strong>Insults intelligence:</strong> "Press A to jump" to a player who has jumped in 100 videogames</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But insufficient guidance damages it too:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> Players stuck without knowing why</li>
              <li><strong>Abandonment:</strong> Players quit rather than guess</li>
              <li><strong>Missed content:</strong> Players don't know features exist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal is guidance that doesn't <em>feel</em> like guidance.</p>

            <h3>Principles</h3>

            <h4>Teach Through Play</h4>
            <p>The best tutorial is a level designed so the correct action is the natural action.</p>
            <p><em>Portal</em>: First room has one exit. The portal is already there. You walk through it. Tutorial complete.</p>

            <h4>Establish Then Test</h4>
            <p>Introduce a concept in a safe environment, then test it with stakes.</p>
            <p><em>Mega Man</em>: First encounter with a new enemy is usually in a safe spot. Later encounters are over pits.</p>

            <h4>Progressive Disclosure</h4>
            <p>Don't teach everything at once. Introduce complexity as the player demonstrates readiness.</p>
            <p><em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>: Great Plateau teaches core systems before releasing you to the world.</p>

            <h4>Failure as Teaching</h4>
            <p>Let players fail in low-stakes ways that teach the lesson.</p>
            <p><em>Dark Souls</em>: You're supposed to die to the first boss. The death teaches that death is part of the videogame.</p>

            <h4>Consistent Rules</h4>
            <p>If the player understands the rules, they can reason from them. Consistent rules reduce hand-holding needs.</p>
            <p><em>Baba Is You</em>: Rules are explicitly stated on screen. Everything follows from them.</p>

            <h3>Techniques</h3>

            <h4>Environmental Cues</h4>
            <p>Use space, light, color, and objects to suggest correct action. (See: <a href="spatial-communication.html">Spatial Communication</a>)</p>

            <h4>Gated Learning</h4>
            <p>Put a skill-gate where the player can't proceed until they've demonstrated understanding.</p>

            <h4>Observational Learning</h4>
            <p>Show NPCs or enemies doing the thing before the player must do it.</p>

            <h4>Safe Experimentation Zones</h4>
            <p>Spaces where the player can try things without consequence.</p>

            <h4>Just-in-Time Information</h4>
            <p>Provide information at the moment of need, not before.</p>

            <h4>Optional Hints</h4>
            <p>Hints that the player can access if stuck, but aren't forced on them. Preserves player agency.</p>

            <h3>The Tooltip Problem</h3>
            <p>Tooltips, button prompts, and tutorial pop-ups work - but at a cost:</p>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Pro</th>
                  <th>Con</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Clear, unambiguous</td>
                  <td>Breaks immersion</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Accessible</td>
                  <td>Can feel patronizing</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Localization-friendly</td>
                  <td>Clutters screen</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Doesn't require level design for teaching</td>
                  <td>Doesn't use level design for teaching</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>The best videogames minimize explicit instruction. But when necessary, make it:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Skippable for experienced players</li>
              <li>Contextual (appears when relevant)</li>
              <li>Brief (don't overexplain)</li>
              <li>Diegetic if possible (character speech, in-world signs)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Onboarding vs. Ongoing Teaching</h3>
            <p><strong>Onboarding:</strong> Teaching new players the basics. First hour. Can be more explicit.</p>
            <p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Teaching new systems mid-game. Should feel like discovery.</p>
            <p>The tolerance for hand-holding decreases as the videogame progresses. Early prompts are expected; mid-game prompts are intrusive.</p>

            <h3>Reading Player Skill</h3>
            <p>Videogames can adapt guidance to player skill:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Death count:</strong> Many deaths = add hints</li>
              <li><strong>Time stuck:</strong> Long time in one area = offer help</li>
              <li><strong>Explicit setting:</strong> "Show hints" option in menu</li>
              <li><strong>Behavioral analysis:</strong> Player isn't using a mechanic = prompt about it</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Resident Evil 4</em> adjusts difficulty based on performance, invisibly. <em>Celeste</em> offers explicit assist mode. Both respect the player.</p>

            <h3>Teaching Notes</h3>
            <p>This topic is deeply connected to <strong>accessibility</strong> - guidance is an accessibility issue. Players with different backgrounds, abilities, and available time need different guidance.</p>

            <h3>Exercise: Blind Playtest</h3>
            <p>Have someone unfamiliar with the videogame play your prototype with no instruction. Watch silently. Where do they struggle? What did they miss?</p>
            <p>Then: redesign to teach those things without adding explicit instruction.</p>

            <h3>Exercise: De-Tutorializing</h3>
            <p>Take a videogame with heavy tutorials. Redesign the first 10 minutes to teach the same things through level design, not text. What has to change?</p>

            <h3>Key Insight</h3>
            <p>Every tutorial prompt is a design failure - something that could have been communicated through play but wasn't. (This is purist and sometimes impractical, but it's a useful frame.)</p>

            <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>"Players will figure it out."</strong> Some will, many won't. The question is whether the failure is theirs or yours.</li>
              <li><strong>"Tutorials are always bad."</strong> Explicit instruction has its place, especially for accessibility. The goal is minimizing unnecessary prompts, not eliminating all guidance.</li>
              <li><strong>"Hard videogames don't need tutorials."</strong> <em>Dark Souls</em> teaches constantly - just through death rather than text. Teaching and difficulty are orthogonal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Assessment Approaches</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Blind playtest:</strong> Watch new players without intervening. Document where they struggle.</li>
              <li><strong>Tutorial audit:</strong> List every explicit instruction in a prototype. For each, ask: could this be taught through design?</li>
              <li><strong>Completion rates:</strong> Track where players abandon the videogame. Correlate with tutorial density.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

            Theory <span class="register-label">- deeper grounding</span>

          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Theoretical Background</h3>

            <h4>Shigeru Miyamoto</h4>
            <p>Nintendo's design philosophy: players should figure things out. <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> are masterclasses in implicit teaching.</p>

            <h4>Fumito Ueda</h4>
            <p><em>Ico</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> famously stripped out tutorials. Trust the player.</p>

            <h4>Keita Takahashi</h4>
            <p><em>Katamari Damacy</em> teaches through scale and tactile feedback. You understand the size you need by feeling it, not reading it.</p>

            <h3>What This Framework Resists</h3>
            <p><strong>The "accessibility means more prompts" assumption.</strong> Accessibility can mean better level design, not more tooltips. The most accessible teaching is the teaching that happens through play.</p>
            <p><strong>The "hardcore = no guidance" assumption.</strong> <em>Dark Souls</em> is famously hard but it <em>does</em> teach. It just teaches through death rather than text.</p>

            <h3>Unresolved Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Accessibility tension:</strong> How do we balance teaching through design with accessibility needs for players who genuinely need explicit instruction?</li>
              <li><strong>Cultural variation:</strong> Are players from different gaming traditions more or less tolerant of explicit guidance?</li>
              <li><strong>Genre expectations:</strong> Some genres (puzzle games, strategy) may require more explicit information than others. Where's the line?</li>
            </ul>
