        <h1>Guidance Without Hand-Holding</h1>
The best videogames teach you everything you need without making you feel taught. You discover; you're not told. You figure it out; you're not shown the answer.
This is <strong>guidance without hand-holding</strong>: creating conditions for learning without removing the satisfaction of learning.
<hr>
<h2>The Hand-Holding Problem</h2>
Hand-holding damages the player experience:
- <strong>Removes discovery:</strong> If the videogame tells you where the secret is, it's not a secret
- <strong>Undercuts mastery:</strong> If the solution is given, solving it isn't an achievement
- <strong>Breaks immersion:</strong> Tutorial prompts remind you you're playing a game
- <strong>Insults intelligence:</strong> "Press A to jump" to a player who has jumped in 100 games
But insufficient guidance damages it too:
- <strong>Frustration:</strong> Players stuck without knowing why
- <strong>Abandonment:</strong> Players quit rather than guess
- <strong>Missed content:</strong> Players don't know features exist
The goal is guidance that doesn't <em>feel</em> like guidance.
<hr>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<h3>Teach Through Play</h3>
The best tutorial is a level designed so the correct action is the natural action.
<em>Portal</em>: First room has one exit. The portal is already there. You walk through it. Tutorial complete.
<h3>Establish Then Test</h3>
Introduce a concept in a safe environment, then test it with stakes.
<em>Mega Man</em>: First encounter with a new enemy is usually in a safe spot. Later encounters are over pits.
<h3>Progressive Disclosure</h3>
Don't teach everything at once. Introduce complexity as the player demonstrates readiness.
<em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>: Great Plateau teaches core systems before releasing you to the world.
<h3>Failure as Teaching</h3>
Let players fail in low-stakes ways that teach the lesson.
<em>Dark Souls</em>: You're supposed to die to the first boss. The death teaches that death is part of the game.
<h3>Consistent Rules</h3>
If the player understands the rules, they can reason from them. Consistent rules reduce hand-holding needs.
<em>Baba Is You</em>: Rules are explicitly stated on screen. Everything follows from them.
<hr>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<h3>Environmental Cues</h3>
Use space, light, color, and objects to suggest correct action. (See: <a href="spatial-communication.html">Spatial Communication</a>)
<h3>Gated Learning</h3>
Put a skill-gate where the player can't proceed until they've demonstrated understanding.
<h3>Observational Learning</h3>
Show NPCs or enemies doing the thing before the player must do it.
<h3>Safe Experimentation Zones</h3>
Spaces where the player can try things without consequence.
<h3>Just-in-Time Information</h3>
Provide information at the moment of need, not before.
<h3>Optional Hints</h3>
Hints that the player can access if stuck, but aren't forced on them. Preserves player agency.
<hr>
<h2>The Tooltip Problem</h2>
Tooltips, button prompts, and tutorial pop-ups work — but at a cost:
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Pro</th><th>Con</th>
</tr></thead><tbody>
</tr>
</tr></thead><tbody>
</tr>
</tr></thead><tbody>
</tbody></table>
<p><tr> <td>Clear, unambiguous</td><td>Breaks immersion</td> <thead><tr> <th>Accessible</th><th>Can feel patronizing</th> <tr> <td>Localization-friendly</td><td>Clutters screen</td> <thead><tr> <th>Doesn't require level design for teaching</th><th>Doesn't use level design for teaching</th></p>
<p>The best videogames minimize explicit instruction. But when necessary, make it: - Skippable for experienced players - Contextual (appears when relevant) - Brief (don't overexplain) - Diegetic if possible (character speech, in-world signs)</p>
<hr>
<h2>Onboarding vs. Ongoing Teaching</h2>
<strong>Onboarding:</strong> Teaching new players the basics. First hour. Can be more explicit.
<strong>Ongoing:</strong> Teaching new systems mid-game. Should feel like discovery.
The tolerance for hand-holding decreases as the videogame progresses. Early prompts are expected; mid-game prompts are intrusive.
<hr>
<h2>Reading Player Skill</h2>
Games can adapt guidance to player skill:
- <strong>Death count:</strong> Many deaths = add hints
- <strong>Time stuck:</strong> Long time in one area = offer help
- <strong>Explicit setting:</strong> "Show hints" option in menu
- <strong>Behavioral analysis:</strong> Player isn't using a mechanic = prompt about it
<em>Resident Evil 4</em> adjusts difficulty based on performance, invisibly. <em>Celeste</em> offers explicit assist mode. Both respect the player.

<h2>Teaching Notes</h2>
This topic is deeply connected to <strong>accessibility</strong> — guidance is an accessibility issue. Players with different backgrounds, abilities, and available time need different guidance.
<strong>Exercise: Blind Playtest</strong>
Have someone unfamiliar with the videogame play your prototype with no instruction. Watch silently. Where do they struggle? What did they miss?
Then: redesign to teach those things without adding explicit instruction.
<strong>Exercise: De-Tutorializing</strong>
Take a videogame with heavy tutorials. Redesign the first 10 minutes to teach the same things through level design, not text. What has to change?
<strong>Key insight:</strong> Every tutorial prompt is a design failure — something that could have been communicated through play but wasn't. (This is purist and sometimes impractical, but it's a useful frame.)

<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
<strong>Key influences:</strong>
<strong>Shigeru Miyamoto</strong> — Nintendo's design philosophy: players should figure things out. <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> are masterclasses in implicit teaching.
<strong>Fumito Ueda</strong> — <em>Ico</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> famously stripped out tutorials. Trust the player.
<strong>Jenova Chen</strong> — <em>Journey</em> teaches through encounter design, not prompts.
<strong>What I'm resisting:</strong>
<strong>The "accessibility means more prompts" assumption.</strong> Accessibility can mean better level design, not more tooltips. The most accessible teaching is the teaching that happens through play.
<strong>The "hardcore = no guidance" assumption.</strong> <em>Dark Souls</em> is famously hard but it <em>does</em> teach. It just teaches through death rather than text.
<strong>Unresolved questions:</strong>
- How do we balance teaching through design with accessibility needs for players who genuinely need explicit instruction?
- Is there a cultural component? Are players from different gaming traditions more or less tolerant of explicit guidance?
