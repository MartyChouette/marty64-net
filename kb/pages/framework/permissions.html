          The boundaries of interface, contact, system, and mechanic. What the videogame allows, requires, and forbids.

          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>What Permissions Are</h3>
            <p>
              Permissions are the boundaries of the experience. They define what's allowed, what's required, 
              and what's forbidden within the videogame's systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every videogame has Permissions, whether the designers intended them or not.
              Some are explicit (you cannot go through this wall). Some are implicit (you would never think to try).
              Some are designed. Some are accidents. All of them shape the experience.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Three Types of Permissions</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Allowed</strong></p>
            <p>
              What the videogame lets you do. The possibility space. 
              Can you jump? Can you talk to NPCs? Can you save anywhere?
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Required</strong></p>
            <p>
              What the videogame makes you do. The demands of progression.
              Must you defeat the boss? Must you watch the cutscene? Must you wait for the timer?
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Forbidden</strong></p>
            <p>
              What the videogame prevents you from doing. The boundaries.
              Cannot harm children NPCs. Cannot skip the tutorial. Cannot return to the previous area.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Discovering Permissions</h3>
            <p>
              We often don't know the Permissions preemptively. We discover them through play, 
              through the <a href="the-four-as.html" class="term">4 A's</a>. It's like feeling in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Action shows us what we can do. The Art signals what might be possible. 
              The Arc reveals what's required to progress. The Atmosphere hints at what kind of 
              experience this is. Through all of these, we come to understand the Permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes we know the Permissions before playing: from genre conventions, from marketing, 
              from other players. But even then, the specific boundaries are felt out through the 
              <a href="gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a> itself.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Permissions and Meaning</h3>
            <p>
              Permissions carry meaning. What a videogame allows, requires, and forbids 
              communicates values, priorities, and worldview.
            </p>
            <p>
              A videogame that forbids killing communicates something different than one that requires it.
              A videogame that allows nonlinear exploration communicates something different than one that requires linear progression.
              These are not neutral technical decisions. They are statements.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Pick a videogame. List:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>3 things the videogame <strong>allows</strong> (but doesn't require)</li>
              <li>3 things the videogame <strong>requires</strong></li>
              <li>3 things the videogame <strong>forbids</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For each: How did you discover this Permission? Through what Action, Art, Arc, or Atmosphere?
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>Why Teach Permissions</h3>
            <p>
              Students often focus on what they're building (features, content) without thinking about 
              what they're constraining. Permissions reframes design: you're not just adding possibilities, 
              you're defining a space of possibility.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Teaching Sequence</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Start with "Forbidden." It's often invisible but powerful. Ask: what can't you do in [videogame]?</li>
              <li>Move to "Required." What must you do to progress? What has no alternative?</li>
              <li>End with "Allowed." This is the space between Required and Forbidden. The space of <a href="../glossary.html#A" class="term">agency</a>.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>The "Permissions Remix" Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Have students take a videogame and change one Permission:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What if <em>Mario</em> couldn't jump? (Forbidden something that was Allowed)</li>
              <li>What if <em>Dark Souls</em> let you pause? (Allowed something that was Forbidden)</li>
              <li>What if <em>Tetris</em> didn't require pieces to fall? (Removed a Requirement)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Discuss: How does this single change affect the whole experience?
            </p>
            
            <h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>
            <p><strong>"More Allowed = better"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students may assume more player freedom is always good. Counter this: 
              constraints create meaning. A videogame that allows everything requires nothing 
              and often feels empty.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>"Required = bad"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students may feel Requirements are limitations to avoid. Counter this: 
              Requirements are how videogames create shared experiences. Without them, 
              there's no guarantee any two players experience the same thing.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              Have students write a "Permissions document" for a videogame they're designing.
              Look for: Do they articulate all three types? Do they explain why each Permission exists?
            </p>

            <h3>Permissions and Procedural Rhetoric</h3>
            <p>
              Ian Bogost's <a href="../glossary.html#P" class="term">procedural rhetoric</a> argues that videogames make arguments through 
              their rules. Permissions are a primary mechanism of this: what you allow, require, 
              and forbid says something.
            </p>
            <p>
              A videogame about war that forbids civilian casualties makes a different argument than 
              one that allows or requires them. The Permission itself is rhetorical.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Permissions and Agency</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="../glossary.html#A" class="term">Agency</a> exists in the space between Required and Forbidden. 
              If everything is Required, there's no agency. If nothing is Forbidden, agency may feel meaningless 
              (there are no stakes to choosing one path over another).
            </p>
            <p>
              The art of Permission design is finding the right constraints: enough Required and Forbidden 
              to give choices weight, enough Allowed to give players room to express themselves.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Permissions vs. Affordances</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="../glossary.html#A" class="term">Affordances</a> (what objects suggest you can do with them) are not the same as Permissions 
              (what the system actually allows). A door may afford opening (it looks like a door) 
              but be Forbidden (the system won't let you open it).
            </p>
            <p>
              Good design often aligns affordance and Permission. When they diverge, players feel frustrated 
              ("why can't I open this door that looks openable?").
            </p>
            
            <h3>Permissions and the 4 A's</h3>
            <p>
              Permissions are not separate from the <a href="gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a>. They are discovered 
              through it. The 4 A's are how we come to understand what's allowed, required, and forbidden.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means Permissions are not purely abstract rules. They are felt, encountered, tested.
              A Permission you never bump against might as well not exist. A Permission you discover 
              through play becomes part of the experience.
            </p>
