            <h3>How the 4 A's Work</h3>
            <p>
              When playing, the 4 A's are inseparable. You experience them as one thing.
              When analyzing, you pull them apart to understand how each contributes to the whole.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Action</h3>
            <p>
              What the videogame has the player do.
            </p>
            <p>
              This includes direct interaction: pressing buttons, moving a character, making choices.
              But it also includes absence of interaction: waiting, watching, being still.
              A cutscene is an Action (the action of watching). A pause is an Action (the action of not acting).
            </p>
            <p>
              Action is not just "<a href="../glossary.html#V" class="term">verbs</a>" or "<a href="../glossary.html#M" class="term">mechanics</a>." 
              It is whatever the videogame asks of the player, whether that asking is explicit or implicit, active or passive.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>
              Art direction, lighting, staging, camera grammar, composition, and sound design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Art is not just "how it looks." It is the full vocabulary of visual and audio craft:
              art direction and style, lighting and color, staging and blocking, camera grammar (angles, movement, cuts),
              composition (what's in frame, what's emphasized), sound design and music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every Art choice has an <a href="aesthetic-heritage.html" class="term">Aesthetic Heritage</a>. 
              A Dutch angle comes from somewhere. A synth soundtrack comes from somewhere.
              Understanding where these choices come from helps you understand why they work (or don't).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Arc</h3>
            <p>
              The amount of time. The shape of the experience over duration.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Arc can be a micro-moment: the 0.2 seconds of a jump's apex.
              Or it can be a long moment: the 10-minute drive through the desert.
              Or it can be the entire videogame: the 40-hour journey from start to credits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arc is not the same as "<a href="../glossary.html#P" class="term">pacing</a>," though pacing is part of it.
              Arc is the temporal container of the <a href="gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a>. 
              It answers: how long does this last, and what shape does it take?
            </p>
            <p>
              A Gesture can nest inside another Gesture. The Arc of a single jump exists inside the Arc of a level,
              which exists inside the Arc of the whole videogame.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>
              The feeling and vibe experienced from the videogame.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atmosphere is what emerges when Action, Art, and Arc combine.
              It is the emotional texture of the experience. The mood. The tone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atmosphere is not something designers add on top. It is what players feel as a result of everything else.
              But designers can and do craft toward specific Atmospheres by shaping the other three A's.
            </p>
            <p>
              Words for Atmosphere: tense, melancholy, cozy, uncanny, triumphant, lonely, frantic, peaceful.
              These are not prescriptions. They are observations of what emerges.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Pick a videogame you know well. Identify one <a href="gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a> (any scale).
              Write one sentence for each A:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Action:</strong> What is the videogame having me do?</li>
              <li><strong>Art:</strong> What do I see and hear? What traditions is it drawing from?</li>
              <li><strong>Arc:</strong> How long does this last? What's its shape?</li>
              <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> What does it feel like?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Teaching the 4 A's</h3>
            <p>
              Introduce the 4 A's only after students have grasped <a href="gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a> as a holistic concept.
              The danger is students treating the 4 A's as a checklist rather than lenses for understanding.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Order of Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Action</strong> first. It's the most intuitive: "What are you doing?"
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Art</strong> second. Students are often visual-first, so this connects quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Atmosphere</strong> third. Once they can identify Action and Art, 
              ask "What does it feel like?" This synthesizes the first two.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Arc</strong> last. Time is the hardest to see. Students need practice with the other three 
              before they can attend to temporal shape.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>
            <p><strong>"Action = button press"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students reduce Action to input. Push them: What about waiting? What about choosing not to act? 
              What about the action of reading text? Watching a cutscene?
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>"Art = graphics quality"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students may conflate Art with fidelity or polish. Redirect: a pixel art videogame has 
              Art choices just as much as a AAA title. What traditions is it drawing from?
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>"Atmosphere is just Art"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students may collapse Atmosphere into Art. Distinguish: Art is what you see/hear; 
              Atmosphere is what you <em>feel</em>. Same Art can produce different Atmospheres with different Actions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              Have students analyze the same videogame moment. Compare their 4 A's breakdowns.
              Differences reveal interpretation, not error. Discuss why different students foreground different A's.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Why Four?</h3>
            <p>
              The 4 A's are not exhaustive. They are a heuristic: four lenses that together cover most of 
              what matters in a <a href="gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a>. Other frameworks slice differently.
            </p>
            <p>
              MDA uses three (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics). Swink's <em>Game Feel</em> focuses on 
              real-time control. The 4 A's emphasize that Action and Art are equally important, 
              and that time (Arc) and feeling (Atmosphere) deserve explicit attention.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Why "Art" and Not "Aesthetics"?</h3>
            <p>
              We use "Art" for the visual/audio component and reserve "Aesthetic" for 
              <a href="aesthetic-heritage.html" class="term">Aesthetic Heritage</a>, which refers to videogames as 
              an aesthetic medium where all 4 A's have lineages.
            </p>
            <p>
              This avoids confusion: "Art" is one of the four components; "Aesthetic Heritage" is 
              the concept that all four have traditions they inherit from.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Problem of Separation</h3>
            <p>
              The 4 A's are analytically distinct but experientially unified. This creates a pedagogical tension:
              we teach students to separate what play unifies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The solution is to always return to <a href="gesture.html" class="term">Gesture</a>. 
              The 4 A's are tools for understanding Gesture, not replacements for it.
              Analysis serves experience, not the other way around.
            </p>
