            <h3>What Gesture Is</h3>
            <p>
              A Gesture is not a single action. It is not a fixed size or length. 
              It is the sum of everything happening when a videogame is being played.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Gesture can be a micro-moment: the split-second of pressing jump and feeling the character leave the ground. 
              Or it can be the entire videogame: the full arc of playing through a 40-hour RPG.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not conflate Gesture with "action" or "mechanic." Gesture contains actions, but it is not reducible to them.
              Gesture is the whole experience at any scale.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The 4 A's</h3>
            <p>A Gesture is composed of four elements, experienced as one thing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Action</strong>: What the videogame has the player do, including absence of interaction</li>
              <li><strong>Art</strong>: Art direction, lighting, staging, camera grammar, composition, sound design</li>
              <li><strong>Arc</strong>: The amount of time. A micro-moment, a long moment, or an entire videogame</li>
              <li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: The feeling and vibe experienced from the videogame</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When playing, these four are inseparable. You experience them as one thing.
              When analyzing, you pull them apart to understand how each contributes to the whole.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analyzing Gesture</h3>
            <p>When you analyze a Gesture, ask:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the <strong>Action</strong>? What is the videogame having me do (or not do)?</li>
              <li>What is the <strong>Art</strong>? What am I seeing, hearing? What traditions is it drawing from?</li>
              <li>What is the <strong>Arc</strong>? How long does this last? What is its shape over time?</li>
              <li>What is the <strong>Atmosphere</strong>? What does it feel like? What vibe does it create?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then ask: Where does each of these come from? What is the <a href="aesthetic-heritage.html" class="term">Aesthetic Heritage</a>?</p>
            
            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Play any videogame for 10 minutes. Pause. Identify one Gesture you just experienced.
              Write down each of the 4 A's. Don't worry about being "right." The goal is to practice seeing.

            Craft <span class="register-label">— for educators</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Why Start Here</h3>
            <p>
              Gesture is the entry point to VG101 because it centers player experience rather than designer abstractions.
              Most frameworks start with mechanics, systems, or rules. These are useful but miss what players actually feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              By starting with "what did you experience?" rather than "what are the rules?", students develop 
              the habit of attending to feel before structure. This prevents the common trap of designing 
              systems that are logical but don't feel right.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Teaching Sequence</h3>
            <p>
              Introduce Gesture before the 4 A's. Let students sit with the holistic concept before 
              giving them analytical tools. The sequence:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Play a short videogame together (5-10 min)</li>
              <li>Ask: "Describe one moment that stuck with you"</li>
              <li>Introduce "Gesture" as a name for that moment</li>
              <li>Only then introduce the 4 A's as a way to analyze Gesture</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
            <p><strong>"Gesture = one button press"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students often want to equate Gesture with a single input. Correct this early: 
              Gesture is about experience, not input. A Gesture can span hours.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>"The 4 A's are separate things"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students may try to analyze each A in isolation. Emphasize that the 4 A's are 
              experienced as one thing. Analysis separates what play unifies.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              For the Gesture concept, assess through writing and discussion, not tests. 
              Look for: Can the student identify a Gesture? Can they articulate what makes it a Gesture 
              rather than just "a mechanic" or "a moment"?

            Theory <span class="register-label">— deeper grounding</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Why "Gesture"</h3>
            <p>
              The term "gesture" is borrowed from multiple traditions: film theory, dance, painting, music, rhetoric.
              In each, gesture refers to a meaningful unit that communicates through form rather than 
              (or in addition to) explicit content.
            </p>
            <p>
              In film theory, gesture connects to <em>mise-en-scène</em>: everything placed within the frame 
              and how it's arranged. The staging, lighting, costume, movement, composition. 
              Mise-en-scène is not just what you see but how seeing is organized to create meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Videogame Gesture extends this: it's not just what's in the frame, but what the player does 
              within and in response to that frame. The surface area of contact includes the player's action.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Relation to Other Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics)</strong>: MDA moves from designer-facing (mechanics) 
              to player-facing (aesthetics). Gesture inverts this: we start with player experience and 
              work backward to understand what produced it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Game Feel (Steve Swink)</strong>: Swink's work on game feel is a major influence. 
              Gesture extends game feel beyond moment-to-moment sensation to encompass longer arcs 
              and atmospheric qualities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Procedural Rhetoric (Ian Bogost)</strong>: Bogost argues videogames make arguments through 
              their rules. Gesture is compatible but broader: meaning emerges from the full sensory-temporal 
              configuration, not just procedural logic.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Unresolved Questions</h3>
            <p>
              How do Gestures nest? If a single jump is a Gesture, and a whole level is a Gesture, 
              what's the relationship? Is it fractal? Hierarchical?
            </p>
            <p>
              Can Gestures fail? Is an unintentional experience still a Gesture? 
              (Current position: yes, Gesture describes what happens, not what was intended.)
            </p>
