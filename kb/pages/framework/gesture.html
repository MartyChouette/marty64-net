            <h3>What Gesture Is</h3>
            <p>
              A Gesture is not necessarily a single action like you may initially imagine. It could be a singular moment or action, but we can also investigate gestures that are a series of actions, a period of play, a second of something silly or spooky occurring, or an entire arc of a character for hundreds of hours. A gesture is just to identify a unit of investigation. A boundary box to the most often elusive experience that is playing videogames.
            </p>
            <p>
              So a Gesture can be a micro-moment: the split-second of pressing jump and feeling the character's movement from the ground. Or it can be the entire videogame: the full story plot and mechanics through a hundred hour RPG.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not conflate Gesture with "action" or "mechanic." Gesture contains these things but is not reducible to them. Gesture is the whole experience at whatever scale the Gesture is being experienced/performed.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The 4 A's</h3>
            <p>A Gesture is composed of four elements, experienced as one thing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Action</strong>: What the videogame has the player do in that Gesture, including the Action of nothing at all!</li>
              <li><strong>Art</strong>: Art direction, lighting, level design, camera grammar, music, sound design, etc.</li>
              <li><strong>Arc</strong>: The amount of time. A moment, a minute, an entire videogame's length.</li>
              <li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: The feeling and ambiance experienced with the videogame</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When playing a videogame we do not parse out all of these separate portions to process them. When analyzing, we attempt to identify how each portion contributes to that singular Gesture being looked at.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analyzing Gesture</h3>
            <p>When you analyze a Gesture, ask:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the <strong>Action</strong>? What are the things I can do (or not do)?</li>
              <li>What is the <strong>Art</strong>? What am I seeing and hearing? What traditions or ideas is the videogame drawing from?</li>
              <li>What is the <strong>Arc</strong>? How long does this last? What is its shape over time?</li>
              <li>What is the <strong>Atmosphere</strong>? What does it feel like? What vibe does it create?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then ask: Where does each of these come from? What is the <a href="aesthetic-heritage.html" class="term">Aesthetic Heritage</a>?</p>
            
            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Play any videogame for 10 minutes. Pause. Identify one Gesture you just experienced.
              Write down each of the 4 A's. Don't worry about being "right." The goal is to practice seeing.

            Craft <span class="register-label">- for educators</span>
          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Why Start Here</h3>
            <p>
              Gesture is the entry point to VG101 because it centers player experience rather than designer abstractions.
              Most frameworks start with mechanics, systems, or rules. These are useful, but we feel like they can miss what players actually feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              By starting with "what did you experience?" rather than "what are the rules/permissions/affordances?", students develop
              the habit of attending to feel before structure. This prevents the common trap of designing
              systems before they are needed, or creating something seemingly logical but
              ends up being vestigial or feeling not right.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Teaching Sequence</h3>
            <p>
              Introduce Gesture before the 4 A's. Let students sit with the holistic concept before
              giving them analytical tools.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Play a short videogame together (5-10 min)</li>
              <li>Ask: "Describe one moment that stuck with you"</li>
              <li>Ask: "What do you think made up that moment? What were its parts?"</li>
              <li>Introduce "Gesture" as a name for that moment</li>
              <li>Only then introduce the 4 A's as a way to analyze Gesture</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
            <p><strong>"Gesture = one button press"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students often want to equate Gesture with a single input. Bring up early that it can
              be a multitude of things dependent on the situation: Gesture is about experience, not input. A Gesture can span seconds or hours.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>"The 4 A's are separate things"</strong></p>
            <p>
              Students may try to analyze each A in isolation. Emphasize that the 4 A's are 
              experienced as one thing. Analysis separates what play unifies.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              For the Gesture concept, assess through discussion.
              Look for: Can the student identify a Gesture? Can they articulate what makes
              it a Gesture rather than just "a mechanic" or "a moment"?

          </div>
          <div class="register-content">
            <h3>Why "Gesture"</h3>
            <p>
              The term "gesture" draws from many sources of inspiration, one of which is Andre Bazin's film theory, where he identified
              gesture as an important unit and facet of painting, film, acting, and other creative forms. Gesture is a
              meaningful unit that communicates through form rather than (or in addition to) explicit content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Videogame Gesture extends Bazin's insight: it's not just what's in the frame, but what the player does
              within and in response to that frame. The surface area of contact includes the player's action.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Relation to Other Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics)</strong>: MDA moves from designer-facing (mechanics) 
              to player-facing (aesthetics). Gesture inverts this: we start with player experience and 
              work backward to understand what produced it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Game Feel (Steve Swink)</strong>: Swink's work on game feel is a major influence. 
              Gesture extends game feel beyond moment-to-moment sensation to encompass longer arcs 
              and atmospheric qualities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Procedural Rhetoric (Ian Bogost)</strong>: Bogost argues videogames make arguments through 
              their rules. Gesture is compatible but broader: meaning emerges from the full sensory-temporal 
              configuration, not just procedural logic.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Common Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Can there be nested gestures? (A gesture in a gesture?)</strong></p>
            <p>
              Yes, of course - you can multiply your analysis however you find useful and informative.
              But please, do not over-complicate things. Gestures and their interrelationships are essential
              to the reading of a videogame, however perceiving gestures inside of gestures is most commonly
              counter-productive.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Can Gestures fail?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Yes and no! There will always be a gap between the intended affect and materialized affect
              in any creative form.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Is an unintentional experience still a Gesture?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Absolutely! The experience a player has is the only experience they have at that moment.
              The systems and what contact looks like with the player to that player is the experience of the gesture.
            </p>
