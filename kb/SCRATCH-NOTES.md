# VG101 Scratch Notes & Future Ideas

This document collects ideas, topics, and notes for future development of the knowledge base.

## Topics to Add to Future Lessons

### Pixels, Layers, and Sprite Sheets
- Using Piskel (mention Aseprite and Krita) to teach and show animation
- Hit pixel art: Mario, Donkey Kong
- Rotoscope 3D object to pixels
- Vector art games

### Polygons and Polygon Density = Aesthetic
- Use Blender to teach
- Brief texture vs vector coloring (might need to be its own section where we use GIMP for image editing, Krita for art)

## Random Excerpts / Things to Include
- Ode to racing videogames
- Couch co-op
- Solo-roto

## Terms That Need Work

**Mediation Craft:** UI/UX, camera/framing, input feel, feedback, pacing, readability, audio language, onboarding.

**Embodiment + Access:** Accessibility as first-order design, player consent/comfort, cognitive load, motor/visual/auditory pathways.

**Aesthetic Inheritance:** How cinema, music, art, theatre, and dance techniques become interactive - authored, systemic, performed.

## Exercising Other Art Forms

This is a section about describing how we are exercising other art forms in our medium, and our medium is to absorb all our inheritance and express ourselves as a videogame, and speak something through gesture.

Examples:
- Still photography → beginning of film just stationary single framed locations
- Pong → table tennis
- Moon lander simulations → high scores

## Why Unity is in This Course

Unity isn't "because industry." Unity is because videogames are a medium of implementation. Your idea only becomes a game when you commit to constraints:

- input
- timing
- state
- feedback
- camera
- audio
- iteration

**Unity is the workshop where those constraints become real. The engine teaches you what your videogame design actually is.**

## What the Final Project Is

The final is not "make a big game." The final is:

**Make one action feel undeniable.**

One or two verbs max. Strong feedback. Clear arc. A small slice with a real identity. The final is a proof that the student understands videogames as a medium, not as a mood board.

## The "Parallel Waves" Add-On (Mobile & Handheld)

The main timeline is oriented around dominant forms. Mobile and handheld don't fit neatly because they're not just "a genre" - they're a change in interface and distribution that reshapes everything.

So we treat mobile/handheld as a parallel current that keeps intersecting the main waves:

### Handheld Lineage
Game Boy → GBA → DS/3DS → Switch as hybrid

Problems: small screen readability, short sessions, battery, tactile clarity, portability

### Mobile Lineage
iPhone era → touch-first design → free-to-play economies

Problems: touch input feel, one-handed play, notification life, monetization ethics, retention loops

### Distribution Lineage
Arcade coins → retail → digital storefronts → live service

Why games changed even when graphics didn't

Students don't need a perfect taxonomy. They need a map that explains why their game exists the way it does.

## Three Parallel Tracks (Interface / Distribution / Form & Culture)

Any given "era" is an overlap of these three tracks.

### Track 1: Interface & Hardware (how we touch the game)
- Mainframe / lab experiments
- Arcade cabinets
- Home console controllers
- Mouse+keyboard PC
- Dual analog + rumble + triggers
- Touchscreens (mobile)
- Motion controls
- VR/AR
- Cloud/remote play

### Track 2: Distribution & Business (how games reach people)
- Coin-op
- Retail cartridges/discs
- Shareware / demos
- Digital storefronts
- Free-to-play + microtransactions
- Live service + battle passes
- Subscriptions + bundles
- Creator economy (mods, UGC, Roblox/Fortnite Creative)

### Track 3: Form & Culture (what "a game" is socially)
- "Computer games" as research toys
- Arcade as youth culture
- Console as household entertainment
- PC genres and mod scenes
- Online multiplayer as third places
- MMOs as virtual life
- eSports + streaming spectatorship
- Indie as auteur / personal games
- "Metagames" and social platforms

**Note:** It's important to see the long legacy of videogames is just as rich through these other lenses and fields, not just through console generations that reflect engineer/entertainment product limitations.
